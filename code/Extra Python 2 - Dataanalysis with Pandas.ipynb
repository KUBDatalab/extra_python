    "## Methods in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to examine how different fairy tales differ in their use of animals. Such an analysis could, for example, include an investigation into the number of times animals are mentioned in the tales. When calculating this, we will need to use various pandas methods, but we should also keep in mind that the tales are not of equal length. So, if we simply count the number of times animals are mentioned in the respective tales, it would be difficult to compare the results. The solution is to normalize the results by dividing the number of times an animal appears (hits) by the total number of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often easiest to start by building something simple and then transform the code into a function that can handle multiple tasks at once. We'll begin by building something that can investigate a single animal occurrence and proceed from there."
