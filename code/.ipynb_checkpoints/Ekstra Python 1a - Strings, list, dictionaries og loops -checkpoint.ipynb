He did not trouble\\r\\nhimself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to\\r\\nthe theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him\\r\\nfor displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of\\r\\nthe day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say,\\r\\n“he is sitting in council,” it was always said of him, “The Emperor is\\r\\nsitting in his wardrobe.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers\\r\\narrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves\\r\\nweavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to\\r\\nweave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the\\r\\nclothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of\\r\\nremaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or\\r\\nwho was extraordinarily simple in character.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!” thought the Emperor. “Had I\\r\\nsuch a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit\\r\\nfor their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the\\r\\nfoolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately.” And he caused\\r\\nlarge sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they\\r\\nmight begin their work directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very\\r\\nbusily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the\\r\\nmost delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own\\r\\nknapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms\\r\\nuntil late at night.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth,”\\r\\n said the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was,\\r\\nhowever, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or\\r\\none unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be\\r\\nsure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he\\r\\nwould prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the\\r\\nweavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All\\r\\nthe people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the\\r\\ncloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how\\r\\nignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,” said the Emperor\\r\\nat last, after some deliberation, “he will be best able to see how the\\r\\ncloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable\\r\\nfor his office than he is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were\\r\\nworking with all their might, at their empty looms. “What can be the\\r\\nmeaning of this?” thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. “I\\r\\ncannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms.” However, he did\\r\\nnot express his thoughts aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come\\r\\nnearer their looms; and then asked him whether the design pleased\\r\\nhim, and whether the colors were not very beautiful; at the same time\\r\\npointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and looked,\\r\\nhe could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason,\\r\\nviz: there was nothing there. “What!” thought he again. “Is it possible\\r\\nthat I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must\\r\\nknow it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No,\\r\\nthat must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see\\r\\nthe stuff.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Sir Minister!” said one of the knaves, still pretending to work.\\r\\n“You do not say whether the stuff pleases you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it is excellent!” replied the old minister, looking at the loom\\r\\nthrough his spectacles. “This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell\\r\\nthe Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall be much obliged to you,” said the impostors, and then they\\r\\nnamed the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended\\r\\nstuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order\\r\\nthat he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for\\r\\nmore silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what\\r\\nthey had begun. However, they put all that was given them into their\\r\\nknapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as\\r\\nbefore at their empty looms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men\\r\\nwere getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be\\r\\nready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister;\\r\\nhe surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the\\r\\nempty frames.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the\\r\\nminister?” asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; at\\r\\nthe same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the\\r\\ndesign and colors which were not there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I certainly am not stupid!” thought the messenger. “It must be, that I\\r\\nam not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no\\r\\none shall know anything about it.” And accordingly he praised the stuff\\r\\nhe could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors\\r\\nand patterns. “Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,” said he to his\\r\\nsovereign when he returned, “the cloth which the weavers are preparing\\r\\nis extraordinarily magnificent.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the Emperor had\\r\\nordered to be woven at his own expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while\\r\\nit was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of\\r\\nthe court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired\\r\\nthe cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were\\r\\naware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than\\r\\never; although they still did not pass a single thread through the\\r\\nlooms.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is not the work absolutely magnificent?” said the two officers of the\\r\\ncrown, already mentioned. “If your Majesty will only be pleased to look\\r\\nat it! What a splendid design! What glorious colors!” and at the same\\r\\ntime they pointed to the empty frames; for they imagined that everyone\\r\\nelse could see this exquisite piece of workmanship.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How is this?” said the Emperor to himself. “I can see nothing! This\\r\\nis indeed a terrible affair! Am I a simpleton, or am I unfit to be an\\r\\nEmperor? That would be the worst thing that could happen--Oh! the cloth\\r\\nis charming,” said he, aloud. “It has my complete approbation.” And he\\r\\nsmiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no\\r\\naccount would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of\\r\\nhis court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes,\\r\\nhoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more\\r\\nthan the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, “Oh, how beautiful!”\\r\\n and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid\\r\\nmaterial, for the approaching procession. “Magnificent! Charming!\\r\\nExcellent!” resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The\\r\\nEmperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors\\r\\nwith the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their\\r\\nbutton-holes, and the title of “Gentlemen Weavers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the\\r\\nprocession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that\\r\\neveryone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new\\r\\nsuit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with\\r\\ntheir scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them.\\r\\n“See!” cried they, at last. “The Emperor's new clothes are ready!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the Emperor, with all the grandees of his court, came to the\\r\\nweavers; and the rogues raised their arms, as if in the act of holding\\r\\nsomething up, saying, “Here are your Majesty's trousers! Here is the\\r\\nscarf! Here is the mantle! The whole suit is as light as a cobweb;\\r\\none might fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it; that,\\r\\nhowever, is the great virtue of this delicate cloth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes indeed!” said all the courtiers, although not one of them could see\\r\\nanything of this exquisite manufacture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your\\r\\nclothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking glass.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended to\\r\\narray him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side to side,\\r\\nbefore the looking glass.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they\\r\\nfit!” everyone cried out. “What a design! What colors! These are indeed\\r\\nroyal robes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession,\\r\\nis waiting,” announced the chief master of the ceremonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am quite ready,” answered the Emperor. “Do my new clothes fit well?”\\r\\n asked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass, in order\\r\\nthat he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty's train felt\\r\\nabout on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle;\\r\\nand pretended to be carrying something; for they would by no means\\r\\nbetray anything like simplicity, or unfitness for their office.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the\\r\\nprocession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people\\r\\nstanding by, and those at the windows, cried out, “Oh! How beautiful\\r\\nare our Emperor's new clothes! What a magnificent train there is to\\r\\nthe mantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!” in short, no one would\\r\\nallow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because, in\\r\\ndoing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit\\r\\nfor his office. Certainly, none of the Emperor's various suits, had ever\\r\\nmade so great an impression, as these invisible ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the Emperor has nothing at all on!” said a little child.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen to the voice of innocence!” exclaimed his father; and what the\\r\\nchild had said was whispered from one to another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he has nothing at all on!” at last cried out all the people.\\r\\nThe Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he\\r\\nthought the procession must go on now! And the lords of the bedchamber\\r\\ntook greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a train, although, in\\r\\nreality, there was no train to hold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SWINEHERD\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a poor Prince, who had a kingdom. His kingdom was very\\r\\nsmall, but still quite large enough to marry upon; and he wished to\\r\\nmarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was certainly rather cool of him to say to the Emperor's daughter,\\r\\n“Will you have me?” But so he did; for his name was renowned far and\\r\\nwide; and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered,\\r\\n“Yes!” and “Thank you kindly.” We shall see what this princess said.\\r\\n\\r\\nListen!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that where the Prince's father lay buried, there grew a rose\\r\\ntree--a most beautiful rose tree, which blossomed only once in every\\r\\nfive years, and even then bore only one flower, but that was a rose!\\r\\nIt smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who\\r\\ninhaled its fragrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd furthermore, the Prince had a nightingale, who could sing in such a\\r\\nmanner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little\\r\\nthroat. So the Princess was to have the rose, and the nightingale; and\\r\\nthey were accordingly put into large silver caskets, and sent to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor had them brought into a large hall, where the Princess was\\r\\nplaying at “Visiting,” with the ladies of the court; and when she saw\\r\\nthe caskets with the presents, she clapped her hands for joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, if it were but a little pussy-cat!” said she; but the rose tree,\\r\\nwith its beautiful rose came to view.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, how prettily it is made!” said all the court ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is more than pretty,” said the Emperor, “it is charming!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Princess touched it, and was almost ready to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fie, papa!” said she. “It is not made at all, it is natural!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us see what is in the other casket, before we get into a bad\\r\\nhumor,” said the Emperor. So the nightingale came forth and sang so\\r\\ndelightfully that at first no one could say anything ill-humored of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Superbe! Charmant!” exclaimed the ladies; for they all used to chatter\\r\\nFrench, each one worse than her neighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How much the bird reminds me of the musical box that belonged to our\\r\\nblessed Empress,” said an old knight. “Oh yes! These are the same tones,\\r\\nthe same execution.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes! yes!” said the Emperor, and he wept like a child at the\\r\\nremembrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will still hope that it is not a real bird,” said the Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it is a real bird,” said those who had brought it. “Well then let\\r\\nthe bird fly,” said the Princess; and she positively refused to see the\\r\\nPrince.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he was not to be discouraged; he daubed his face over brown and\\r\\nblack; pulled his cap over his ears, and knocked at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good day to my lord, the Emperor!” said he. “Can I have employment at\\r\\nthe palace?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, yes,” said the Emperor. “I want some one to take care of the pigs,\\r\\nfor we have a great many of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Prince was appointed “Imperial Swineherd.” He had a dirty little\\r\\nroom close by the pigsty; and there he sat the whole day, and worked. By\\r\\nthe evening he had made a pretty little kitchen-pot. Little bells were\\r\\nhung all round it; and when the pot was boiling, these bells tinkled in\\r\\nthe most charming manner, and played the old melody,\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Ach! du lieber Augustin,\\r\\n    Alles ist weg, weg, weg!”*\\r\\n\\r\\n    * “Ah! dear Augustine!\\r\\n    All is gone, gone, gone!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what was still more curious, whoever held his finger in the smoke of\\r\\nthe kitchen-pot, immediately smelt all the dishes that were cooking on\\r\\nevery hearth in the city--this, you see, was something quite different\\r\\nfrom the rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Princess happened to walk that way; and when she heard the tune,\\r\\nshe stood quite still, and seemed pleased; for she could play “Lieber\\r\\nAugustine”; it was the only piece she knew; and she played it with one\\r\\nfinger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why there is my piece,” said the Princess. “That swineherd must\\r\\ncertainly have been well educated! Go in and ask him the price of the\\r\\ninstrument.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo one of the court-ladies must run in; however, she drew on wooden\\r\\nslippers first.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What will you take for the kitchen-pot?” said the lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will have ten kisses from the Princess,” said the swineherd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, indeed!” said the lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot sell it for less,” rejoined the swineherd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is an impudent fellow!” said the Princess, and she walked on; but\\r\\nwhen she had gone a little way, the bells tinkled so prettily\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Ach! du lieber Augustin,\\r\\n    Alles ist weg, weg, weg!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay,” said the Princess. “Ask him if he will have ten kisses from the\\r\\nladies of my court.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, thank you!” said the swineherd. “Ten kisses from the Princess, or I\\r\\nkeep the kitchen-pot myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That must not be, either!” said the Princess. “But do you all stand\\r\\nbefore me that no one may see us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the court-ladies placed themselves in front of her, and spread\\r\\nout their dresses--the swineherd got ten kisses, and the Princess--the\\r\\nkitchen-pot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was delightful! The pot was boiling the whole evening, and the\\r\\nwhole of the following day. They knew perfectly well what was cooking at\\r\\nevery fire throughout the city, from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's;\\r\\nthe court-ladies danced and clapped their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We know who has soup, and who has pancakes for dinner to-day, who has\\r\\ncutlets, and who has eggs. How interesting!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but keep my secret, for I am an Emperor's daughter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swineherd--that is to say--the Prince, for no one knew that he was\\r\\nother than an ill-favored swineherd, let not a day pass without working\\r\\nat something; he at last constructed a rattle, which, when it was swung\\r\\nround, played all the waltzes and jig tunes, which have ever been heard\\r\\nsince the creation of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that is superbe!” said the Princess when she passed by. “I have\\r\\nnever heard prettier compositions! Go in and ask him the price of the\\r\\ninstrument; but mind, he shall have no more kisses!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He will have a hundred kisses from the Princess!” said the lady who had\\r\\nbeen to ask.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think he is not in his right senses!” said the Princess, and walked\\r\\non, but when she had gone a little way, she stopped again. “One must\\r\\nencourage art,” said she, “I am the Emperor's daughter. Tell him he\\r\\nshall, as on yesterday, have ten kisses from me, and may take the rest\\r\\nfrom the ladies of the court.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh--but we should not like that at all!” said they. “What are you\\r\\nmuttering?” asked the Princess. “If I can kiss him, surely you can.\\r\\nRemember that you owe everything to me.” So the ladies were obliged to\\r\\ngo to him again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A hundred kisses from the Princess,” said he, “or else let everyone\\r\\nkeep his own!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stand round!” said she; and all the ladies stood round her whilst the\\r\\nkissing was going on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What can be the reason for such a crowd close by the pigsty?” said the\\r\\nEmperor, who happened just then to step out on the balcony; he rubbed\\r\\nhis eyes, and put on his spectacles. “They are the ladies of the\\r\\ncourt; I must go down and see what they are about!” So he pulled up his\\r\\nslippers at the heel, for he had trodden them down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he had got into the court-yard, he moved very softly, and the\\r\\nladies were so much engrossed with counting the kisses, that all might\\r\\ngo on fairly, that they did not perceive the Emperor. He rose on his\\r\\ntiptoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is all this?” said he, when he saw what was going on, and he boxed\\r\\nthe Princess's ears with his slipper, just as the swineherd was taking\\r\\nthe eighty-sixth kiss.\\r\\n\\r\\n“March out!” said the Emperor, for he was very angry; and both Princess\\r\\nand swineherd were thrust out of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Princess now stood and wept, the swineherd scolded, and the rain\\r\\npoured down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alas! Unhappy creature that I am!” said the Princess. “If I had but\\r\\nmarried the handsome young Prince! Ah! how unfortunate I am!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the swineherd went behind a tree, washed the black and brown color\\r\\nfrom his face, threw off his dirty clothes, and stepped forth in his\\r\\nprincely robes; he looked so noble that the Princess could not help\\r\\nbowing before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am come to despise thee,” said he. “Thou would'st not have an\\r\\nhonorable Prince! Thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale,\\r\\nbut thou wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake of a trumpery\\r\\nplaything. Thou art rightly served.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then went back to his own little kingdom, and shut the door of his\\r\\npalace in her face. Now she might well sing,\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Ach! du lieber Augustin,\\r\\n    Alles ist weg, weg, weg!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE REAL PRINCESS\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a Prince who wished to marry a Princess; but then she\\r\\nmust be a real Princess. He travelled all over the world in hopes of\\r\\nfinding such a lady; but there was always something wrong. Princesses he\\r\\nfound in plenty; but whether they were real Princesses it was impossible\\r\\nfor him to decide, for now one thing, now another, seemed to him not\\r\\nquite right about the ladies. At last he returned to his palace quite\\r\\ncast down, because he wished so much to have a real Princess for his\\r\\nwife.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening a fearful tempest arose, it thundered and lightened, and the\\r\\nrain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides, it was as dark as\\r\\npitch. All at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door, and\\r\\nthe old King, the Prince's father, went out himself to open it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a Princess who was standing outside the door. What with the rain\\r\\nand the wind, she was in a sad condition; the water trickled down from\\r\\nher hair, and her clothes clung to her body. She said she was a real\\r\\nPrincess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! we shall soon see that!” thought the old Queen-mother; however, she\\r\\nsaid not a word of what she was going to do; but went quietly into the\\r\\nbedroom, took all the bed-clothes off the bed, and put three little peas\\r\\non the bedstead. She then laid twenty mattresses one upon another over\\r\\nthe three peas, and put twenty feather beds over the mattresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this bed the Princess was to pass the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she was asked how she had slept. “Oh, very badly\\r\\nindeed!” she replied. “I have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night\\r\\nthrough. I do not know what was in my bed, but I had something hard\\r\\nunder me, and am all over black and blue. It has hurt me so much!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it was plain that the lady must be a real Princess, since she had\\r\\nbeen able to feel the three little peas through the twenty mattresses\\r\\nand twenty feather beds. None but a real Princess could have had such a\\r\\ndelicate sense of feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prince accordingly made her his wife; being now convinced that he\\r\\nhad found a real Princess. The three peas were however put into the\\r\\ncabinet of curiosities, where they are still to be seen, provided they\\r\\nare not lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nWasn't this a lady of real delicacy?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SHOES OF FORTUNE\\r\\n\\r\\nI. A Beginning\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery author has some peculiarity in his descriptions or in his style\\r\\nof writing. Those who do not like him, magnify it, shrug up their\\r\\nshoulders, and exclaim--there he is again! I, for my part, know very\\r\\nwell how I can bring about this movement and this exclamation. It would\\r\\nhappen immediately if I were to begin here, as I intended to do, with:\\r\\n“Rome has its Corso, Naples its Toledo”--“Ah! that Andersen; there he is\\r\\nagain!” they would cry; yet I must, to please my fancy, continue quite\\r\\nquietly, and add: “But Copenhagen has its East Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, then, we will stay for the present. In one of the houses not far\\r\\nfrom the new market a party was invited--a very large party, in order,\\r\\nas is often the case, to get a return invitation from the others. One\\r\\nhalf of the company was already seated at the card-table, the other half\\r\\nawaited the result of the stereotype preliminary observation of the lady\\r\\nof the house:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now let us see what we can do to amuse ourselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had got just so far, and the conversation began to crystallise,\\r\\nas it could but do with the scanty stream which the commonplace world\\r\\nsupplied. Amongst other things they spoke of the middle ages: some\\r\\npraised that period as far more interesting, far more poetical than our\\r\\nown too sober present; indeed Councillor Knap defended this opinion\\r\\nso warmly, that the hostess declared immediately on his side, and both\\r\\nexerted themselves with unwearied eloquence. The Councillor boldly\\r\\ndeclared the time of King Hans to be the noblest and the most happy\\r\\nperiod.*\\r\\n\\r\\n* A.D. 1482-1513\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the conversation turned on this subject, and was only for a moment\\r\\ninterrupted by the arrival of a journal that contained nothing worth\\r\\nreading, we will just step out into the antechamber, where cloaks,\\r\\nmackintoshes, sticks, umbrellas, and shoes, were deposited. Here sat two\\r\\nfemale figures, a young and an old one. One might have thought at first\\r\\nthey were servants come to accompany their mistresses home; but on\\r\\nlooking nearer, one soon saw they could scarcely be mere servants; their\\r\\nforms were too noble for that, their skin too fine, the cut of their\\r\\ndress too striking. Two fairies were they; the younger, it is true,\\r\\nwas not Dame Fortune herself, but one of the waiting-maids of her\\r\\nhandmaidens who carry about the lesser good things that she distributes;\\r\\nthe other looked extremely gloomy--it was Care. She always attends to\\r\\nher own serious business herself, as then she is sure of having it done\\r\\nproperly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were telling each other, with a confidential interchange of ideas,\\r\\nwhere they had been during the day. The messenger of Fortune had only\\r\\nexecuted a few unimportant commissions, such as saving a new bonnet from\\r\\na shower of rain, etc.; but what she had yet to perform was something\\r\\nquite unusual.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must tell you,” said she, “that to-day is my birthday; and in honor\\r\\nof it, a pair of walking-shoes or galoshes has been entrusted to me,\\r\\nwhich I am to carry to mankind. These shoes possess the property of\\r\\ninstantly transporting him who has them on to the place or the period\\r\\nin which he most wishes to be; every wish, as regards time or place, or\\r\\nstate of being, will be immediately fulfilled, and so at last man will\\r\\nbe happy, here below.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you seriously believe it?” replied Care, in a severe tone of\\r\\nreproach. “No; he will be very unhappy, and will assuredly bless the\\r\\nmoment when he feels that he has freed himself from the fatal shoes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stupid nonsense!” said the other angrily. “I will put them here by\\r\\nthe door. Some one will make a mistake for certain and take the wrong\\r\\nones--he will be a happy man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was their conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII. What Happened to the Councillor\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late; Councillor Knap, deeply occupied with the times of King\\r\\nHans, intended to go home, and malicious Fate managed matters so that\\r\\nhis feet, instead of finding their way to his own galoshes, slipped\\r\\ninto those of Fortune. Thus caparisoned the good man walked out of the\\r\\nwell-lighted rooms into East Street. By the magic power of the shoes he\\r\\nwas carried back to the times of King Hans; on which account his foot\\r\\nvery naturally sank in the mud and puddles of the street, there having\\r\\nbeen in those days no pavement in Copenhagen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well! This is too bad! How dirty it is here!” sighed the Councillor.\\r\\n“As to a pavement, I can find no traces of one, and all the lamps, it\\r\\nseems, have gone to sleep.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon was not yet very high; it was besides rather foggy, so that\\r\\nin the darkness all objects seemed mingled in chaotic confusion. At the\\r\\nnext corner hung a votive lamp before a Madonna, but the light it gave\\r\\nwas little better than none at all; indeed, he did not observe it before\\r\\nhe was exactly under it, and his eyes fell upon the bright colors of the\\r\\npictures which represented the well-known group of the Virgin and the\\r\\ninfant Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is probably a wax-work show,” thought he; “and the people delay\\r\\ntaking down their sign in hopes of a late visitor or two.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA few persons in the costume of the time of King Hans passed quickly by\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How strange they look! The good folks come probably from a masquerade!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly was heard the sound of drums and fifes; the bright blaze of a\\r\\nfire shot up from time to time, and its ruddy gleams seemed to contend\\r\\nwith the bluish light of the torches. The Councillor stood still, and\\r\\nwatched a most strange procession pass by. First came a dozen drummers,\\r\\nwho understood pretty well how to handle their instruments; then came\\r\\nhalberdiers, and some armed with cross-bows. The principal person in the\\r\\nprocession was a priest. Astonished at what he saw, the Councillor asked\\r\\nwhat was the meaning of all this mummery, and who that man was.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That's the Bishop of Zealand,” was the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Heavens! What has taken possession of the Bishop?” sighed the\\r\\nCouncillor, shaking his head. It certainly could not be the Bishop; even\\r\\nthough he was considered the most absent man in the whole kingdom, and\\r\\npeople told the drollest anecdotes about him. Reflecting on the matter,\\r\\nand without looking right or left, the Councillor went through East\\r\\nStreet and across the Habro-Platz. The bridge leading to Palace Square\\r\\nwas not to be found; scarcely trusting his senses, the nocturnal\\r\\nwanderer discovered a shallow piece of water, and here fell in with two\\r\\nmen who very comfortably were rocking to and fro in a boat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does your honor want to cross the ferry to the Holme?” asked they.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Across to the Holme!” said the Councillor, who knew nothing of the age\\r\\nin which he at that moment was. “No, I am going to Christianshafen, to\\r\\nLittle Market Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth men stared at him in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only just tell me where the bridge is,” said he. “It is really\\r\\nunpardonable that there are no lamps here; and it is as dirty as if one\\r\\nhad to wade through a morass.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longer he spoke with the boatmen, the more unintelligible did their\\r\\nlanguage become to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don't understand your Bornholmish dialect,” said he at last, angrily,\\r\\nand turning his back upon them. He was unable to find the bridge: there\\r\\nwas no railway either. “It is really disgraceful what a state this place\\r\\nis in,” muttered he to himself. Never had his age, with which, however,\\r\\nhe was always grumbling, seemed so miserable as on this evening. “I'll\\r\\ntake a hackney-coach!” thought he. But where were the hackney-coaches?\\r\\nNot one was to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must go back to the New Market; there, it is to be hoped, I\\r\\nshall find some coaches; for if I don't, I shall never get safe to\\r\\nChristianshafen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo off he went in the direction of East Street, and had nearly got to\\r\\nthe end of it when the moon shone forth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“God bless me! What wooden scaffolding is that which they have set up\\r\\nthere?” cried he involuntarily, as he looked at East Gate, which, in\\r\\nthose days, was at the end of East Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found, however, a little side-door open, and through this he went,\\r\\nand stepped into our New Market of the present time. It was a huge\\r\\ndesolate plain; some wild bushes stood up here and there, while across\\r\\nthe field flowed a broad canal or river. Some wretched hovels for the\\r\\nDutch sailors, resembling great boxes, and after which the place was\\r\\nnamed, lay about in confused disorder on the opposite bank.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I either behold a fata morgana, or I am regularly tipsy,” whimpered out\\r\\nthe Councillor. “But what's this?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned round anew, firmly convinced that he was seriously ill. He\\r\\ngazed at the street formerly so well known to him, and now so strange in\\r\\nappearance, and looked at the houses more attentively: most of them were\\r\\nof wood, slightly put together; and many had a thatched roof.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No--I am far from well,” sighed he; “and yet I drank only one glass of\\r\\npunch; but I cannot suppose it--it was, too, really very wrong to give\\r\\nus punch and hot salmon for supper. I shall speak about it at the first\\r\\nopportunity. I have half a mind to go back again, and say what I suffer.\\r\\nBut no, that would be too silly; and Heaven only knows if they are up\\r\\nstill.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked for the house, but it had vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is really dreadful,” groaned he with increasing anxiety; “I cannot\\r\\nrecognise East Street again; there is not a single decent shop from one\\r\\nend to the other! Nothing but wretched huts can I see anywhere; just\\r\\nas if I were at Ringstead. Oh! I am ill! I can scarcely bear myself any\\r\\nlonger. Where the deuce can the house be? It must be here on this very\\r\\nspot; yet there is not the slightest idea of resemblance, to such a\\r\\ndegree has everything changed this night! At all events here are some\\r\\npeople up and stirring. Oh! oh! I am certainly very ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now hit upon a half-open door, through a chink of which a faint light\\r\\nshone. It was a sort of hostelry of those times; a kind of public-house.\\r\\nThe room had some resemblance to the clay-floored halls in Holstein; a\\r\\npretty numerous company, consisting of seamen, Copenhagen burghers, and\\r\\na few scholars, sat here in deep converse over their pewter cans, and\\r\\ngave little heed to the person who entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By your leave!” said the Councillor to the Hostess, who came bustling\\r\\ntowards him. “I've felt so queer all of a sudden; would you have the\\r\\ngoodness to send for a hackney-coach to take me to Christianshafen?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman examined him with eyes of astonishment, and shook her head;\\r\\nshe then addressed him in German. The Councillor thought she did not\\r\\nunderstand Danish, and therefore repeated his wish in German. This, in\\r\\nconnection with his costume, strengthened the good woman in the belief\\r\\nthat he was a foreigner. That he was ill, she comprehended directly; so\\r\\nshe brought him a pitcher of water, which tasted certainly pretty strong\\r\\nof the sea, although it had been fetched from the well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Councillor supported his head on his hand, drew a long breath, and\\r\\nthought over all the wondrous things he saw around him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is this the Daily News of this evening?” he asked mechanically, as he\\r\\nsaw the Hostess push aside a large sheet of paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meaning of this councillorship query remained, of course, a riddle\\r\\nto her, yet she handed him the paper without replying. It was a coarse\\r\\nwood-cut, representing a splendid meteor “as seen in the town of\\r\\nCologne,” which was to be read below in bright letters.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is very old!” said the Councillor, whom this piece of antiquity\\r\\nbegan to make considerably more cheerful. “Pray how did you come into\\r\\npossession of this rare print? It is extremely interesting, although the\\r\\nwhole is a mere fable. Such meteorous appearances are to be explained in\\r\\nthis way--that they are the reflections of the Aurora Borealis, and it\\r\\nis highly probable they are caused principally by electricity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThose persons who were sitting nearest him and heard his speech,\\r\\nstared at him in wonderment; and one of them rose, took off his hat\\r\\nrespectfully, and said with a serious countenance, “You are no doubt a\\r\\nvery learned man, Monsieur.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no,” answered the Councillor, “I can only join in conversation on\\r\\nthis topic and on that, as indeed one must do according to the demands\\r\\nof the world at present.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Modestia is a fine virtue,” continued the gentleman; “however, as to\\r\\nyour speech, I must say mihi secus videtur: yet I am willing to suspend\\r\\nmy judicium.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“May I ask with whom I have the pleasure of speaking?” asked the\\r\\nCouncillor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am a Bachelor in Theologia,” answered the gentleman with a stiff\\r\\nreverence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reply fully satisfied the Councillor; the title suited the dress.\\r\\n“He is certainly,” thought he, “some village schoolmaster--some queer\\r\\nold fellow, such as one still often meets with in Jutland.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is no locus docendi, it is true,” began the clerical gentleman;\\r\\n“yet I beg you earnestly to let us profit by your learning. Your reading\\r\\nin the ancients is, sine dubio, of vast extent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, I've read something, to be sure,” replied the Councillor. “I\\r\\nlike reading all useful works; but I do not on that account despise the\\r\\nmodern ones; 'tis only the unfortunate 'Tales of Every-day Life' that I\\r\\ncannot bear--we have enough and more than enough such in reality.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tales of Every-day Life?'” said our Bachelor inquiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean those new fangled novels, twisting and writhing themselves in\\r\\nthe dust of commonplace, which also expect to find a reading public.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” exclaimed the clerical gentleman smiling, “there is much wit in\\r\\nthem; besides they are read at court. The King likes the history of Sir\\r\\nIffven and Sir Gaudian particularly, which treats of King Arthur, and\\r\\nhis Knights of the Round Table; he has more than once joked about it\\r\\nwith his high vassals.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have not read that novel,” said the Councillor; “it must be quite a\\r\\nnew one, that Heiberg has published lately.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” answered the theologian of the time of King Hans: “that book is\\r\\nnot written by a Heiberg, but was imprinted by Godfrey von Gehmen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, is that the author's name?” said the Councillor. “It is a very\\r\\nold name, and, as well as I recollect, he was the first printer that\\r\\nappeared in Denmark.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he is our first printer,” replied the clerical gentleman hastily.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far all went on well. Some one of the worthy burghers now spoke of\\r\\nthe dreadful pestilence that had raged in the country a few years back,\\r\\nmeaning that of 1484. The Councillor imagined it was the cholera that\\r\\nwas meant, which people made so much fuss about; and the discourse\\r\\npassed off satisfactorily enough. The war of the buccaneers of 1490 was\\r\\nso recent that it could not fail being alluded to; the English\\r\\npirates had, they said, most shamefully taken their ships while in the\\r\\nroadstead; and the Councillor, before whose eyes the Herostratic [*]\\r\\nevent of 1801 still floated vividly, agreed entirely with the others in\\r\\nabusing the rascally English. With other topics he was not so fortunate;\\r\\nevery moment brought about some new confusion, and threatened to become\\r\\na perfect Babel; for the worthy Bachelor was really too ignorant, and\\r\\nthe simplest observations of the Councillor sounded to him too daring\\r\\nand phantastical. They looked at one another from the crown of the head\\r\\nto the soles of the feet; and when matters grew to too high a\\r\\npitch, then the Bachelor talked Latin, in the hope of being better\\r\\nunderstood--but it was of no use after all.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * Herostratus, or Eratostratus--an Ephesian, who wantonly\\r\\n     set fire to the famous temple of Diana, in order to\\r\\n     commemorate his name by so uncommon an action.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What's the matter?” asked the Hostess, plucking the Councillor by the\\r\\nsleeve; and now his recollection returned, for in the course of the\\r\\nconversation he had entirely forgotten all that had preceded it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Merciful God, where am I!” exclaimed he in agony; and while he so\\r\\nthought, all his ideas and feelings of overpowering dizziness, against\\r\\nwhich he struggled with the utmost power of desperation, encompassed\\r\\nhim with renewed force. “Let us drink claret and mead, and Bremen beer,”\\r\\n shouted one of the guests--“and you shall drink with us!”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo maidens approached. One wore a cap of two staring colors, denoting\\r\\nthe class of persons to which she belonged. They poured out the liquor,\\r\\nand made the most friendly gesticulations; while a cold perspiration\\r\\ntrickled down the back of the poor Councillor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What's to be the end of this! What's to become of me!” groaned he; but\\r\\nhe was forced, in spite of his opposition, to drink with the rest. They\\r\\ntook hold of the worthy man; who, hearing on every side that he was\\r\\nintoxicated, did not in the least doubt the truth of this certainly\\r\\nnot very polite assertion; but on the contrary, implored the ladies\\r\\nand gentlemen present to procure him a hackney-coach: they, however,\\r\\nimagined he was talking Russian.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever before, he thought, had he been in such a coarse and ignorant\\r\\ncompany; one might almost fancy the people had turned heathens again.\\r\\n“It is the most dreadful moment of my life: the whole world is leagued\\r\\nagainst me!” But suddenly it occurred to him that he might stoop down\\r\\nunder the table, and then creep unobserved out of the door. He did so;\\r\\nbut just as he was going, the others remarked what he was about; they\\r\\nlaid hold of him by the legs; and now, happily for him, off fell his\\r\\nfatal shoes--and with them the charm was at an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Councillor saw quite distinctly before him a lantern burning, and\\r\\nbehind this a large handsome house. All seemed to him in proper order as\\r\\nusual; it was East Street, splendid and elegant as we now see it. He lay\\r\\nwith his feet towards a doorway, and exactly opposite sat the watchman\\r\\nasleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gracious Heaven!” said he. “Have I lain here in the street and dreamed?\\r\\nYes; 'tis East Street! How splendid and light it is! But really it is\\r\\nterrible what an effect that one glass of punch must have had on me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo minutes later, he was sitting in a hackney-coach and driving to\\r\\nFrederickshafen. He thought of the distress and agony he had endured,\\r\\nand praised from the very bottom of his heart the happy reality--our own\\r\\ntime--which, with all its deficiencies, is yet much better than that in\\r\\nwhich, so much against his inclination, he had lately been.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII. The Watchman's Adventure\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, there is a pair of galoshes, as sure as I'm alive!” said the\\r\\nwatchman, awaking from a gentle slumber. “They belong no doubt to the\\r\\nlieutenant who lives over the way. They lie close to the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worthy man was inclined to ring and deliver them at the house, for\\r\\nthere was still a light in the window; but he did not like disturbing\\r\\nthe other people in their beds, and so very considerately he left the\\r\\nmatter alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Such a pair of shoes must be very warm and comfortable,” said he; “the\\r\\nleather is so soft and supple.” They fitted his feet as though they\\r\\nhad been made for him. “'Tis a curious world we live in,” continued he,\\r\\nsoliloquizing. “There is the lieutenant, now, who might go quietly to\\r\\nbed if he chose, where no doubt he could stretch himself at his ease;\\r\\nbut does he do it? No; he saunters up and down his room, because,\\r\\nprobably, he has enjoyed too many of the good things of this world at\\r\\nhis dinner. That's a happy fellow! He has neither an infirm mother, nor\\r\\na whole troop of everlastingly hungry children to torment him. Every\\r\\nevening he goes to a party, where his nice supper costs him nothing:\\r\\nwould to Heaven I could but change with him! How happy should I be!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile expressing his wish, the charm of the shoes, which he had put on,\\r\\nbegan to work; the watchman entered into the being and nature of the\\r\\nlieutenant. He stood in the handsomely furnished apartment, and held\\r\\nbetween his fingers a small sheet of rose-colored paper, on which some\\r\\nverses were written--written indeed by the officer himself; for who has\\r\\nnot, at least once in his life, had a lyrical moment? And if one then\\r\\nmarks down one's thoughts, poetry is produced. But here was written:\\r\\n\\r\\n                  OH, WERE I RICH!\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Oh, were I rich! Such was my wish, yea such\\r\\n      When hardly three feet high, I longed for much.\\r\\n       Oh, were I rich! an officer were I,\\r\\n       With sword, and uniform, and plume so high.\\r\\n       And the time came, and officer was I!\\r\\n     But yet I grew not rich. Alas, poor me!\\r\\n     Have pity, Thou, who all man's wants dost see.\\r\\n\\r\\n        “I sat one evening sunk in dreams of bliss,\\r\\n      A maid of seven years old gave me a kiss,\\r\\n       I at that time was rich in poesy\\r\\n       And tales of old, though poor as poor could be;\\r\\n       But all she asked for was this poesy.\\r\\n     Then was I rich, but not in gold, poor me!\\r\\n     As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.\\r\\n\\r\\n        “Oh, were I rich! Oft asked I for this boon.\\r\\n      The child grew up to womanhood full soon.\\r\\n       She is so pretty, clever, and so kind\\r\\n     Oh, did she know what's hidden in my mind--\\r\\n       A tale of old. Would she to me were kind!\\r\\n     But I'm condemned to silence! oh, poor me!\\r\\n     As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.\\r\\n\\r\\n        “Oh, were I rich in calm and peace of mind,\\r\\n      My grief you then would not here written find!\\r\\n       O thou, to whom I do my heart devote,\\r\\n       Oh read this page of glad days now remote,\\r\\n       A dark, dark tale, which I tonight devote!\\r\\n     Dark is the future now. Alas, poor me!\\r\\n     Have pity Thou, who all men's pains dost see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch verses as these people write when they are in love! But no man\\r\\nin his senses ever thinks of printing them. Here one of the sorrows of\\r\\nlife, in which there is real poetry, gave itself vent; not that\\r\\nbarren grief which the poet may only hint at, but never depict in its\\r\\ndetail--misery and want: that animal necessity, in short, to snatch\\r\\nat least at a fallen leaf of the bread-fruit tree, if not at the fruit\\r\\nitself. The higher the position in which one finds oneself transplanted,\\r\\nthe greater is the suffering. Everyday necessity is the stagnant pool of\\r\\nlife--no lovely picture reflects itself therein. Lieutenant, love, and\\r\\nlack of money--that is a symbolic triangle, or much the same as the\\r\\nhalf of the shattered die of Fortune. This the lieutenant felt most\\r\\npoignantly, and this was the reason he leant his head against the\\r\\nwindow, and sighed so deeply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The poor watchman out there in the street is far happier than I. He\\r\\nknows not what I term privation. He has a home, a wife, and children,\\r\\nwho weep with him over his sorrows, who rejoice with him when he is\\r\\nglad. Oh, far happier were I, could I exchange with him my being--with\\r\\nhis desires and with his hopes perform the weary pilgrimage of life! Oh,\\r\\nhe is a hundred times happier than I!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same moment the watchman was again watchman. It was the shoes\\r\\nthat caused the metamorphosis by means of which, unknown to himself, he\\r\\ntook upon him the thoughts and feelings of the officer; but, as we have\\r\\njust seen, he felt himself in his new situation much less contented,\\r\\nand now preferred the very thing which but some minutes before he had\\r\\nrejected. So then the watchman was again watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was an unpleasant dream,” said he; “but 'twas droll enough\\r\\naltogether. I fancied that I was the lieutenant over there: and yet\\r\\nthe thing was not very much to my taste after all. I missed my good old\\r\\nmother and the dear little ones; who almost tear me to pieces for sheer\\r\\nlove.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seated himself once more and nodded: the dream continued to haunt\\r\\nhim, for he still had the shoes on his feet. A falling star shone in the\\r\\ndark firmament.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There falls another star,” said he: “but what does it matter; there\\r\\nare always enough left. I should not much mind examining the little\\r\\nglimmering things somewhat nearer, especially the moon; for that would\\r\\nnot slip so easily through a man's fingers. When we die--so at least\\r\\nsays the student, for whom my wife does the washing--we shall fly about\\r\\nas light as a feather from one such a star to the other. That's, of\\r\\ncourse, not true: but 'twould be pretty enough if it were so. If I could\\r\\nbut once take a leap up there, my body might stay here on the steps for\\r\\nwhat I care.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBehold--there are certain things in the world to which one ought never\\r\\nto give utterance except with the greatest caution; but doubly careful\\r\\nmust one be when we have the Shoes of Fortune on our feet. Now just\\r\\nlisten to what happened to the watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to ourselves, we all know the speed produced by the employment of\\r\\nsteam; we have experienced it either on railroads, or in boats when\\r\\ncrossing the sea; but such a flight is like the travelling of a sloth in\\r\\ncomparison with the velocity with which light moves. It flies nineteen\\r\\nmillion times faster than the best race-horse; and yet electricity is\\r\\nquicker still. Death is an electric shock which our heart receives; the\\r\\nfreed soul soars upwards on the wings of electricity. The sun's light\\r\\nwants eight minutes and some seconds to perform a journey of more than\\r\\ntwenty million of our Danish [*] miles; borne by electricity, the soul\\r\\nwants even some minutes less to accomplish the same flight. To it the\\r\\nspace between the heavenly bodies is not greater than the distance\\r\\nbetween the homes of our friends in town is for us, even if they live a\\r\\nshort way from each other; such an electric shock in the heart, however,\\r\\ncosts us the use of the body here below; unless, like the watchman of\\r\\nEast Street, we happen to have on the Shoes of Fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * A Danish mile is nearly 4 3/4 English.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few seconds the watchman had done the fifty-two thousand of our\\r\\nmiles up to the moon, which, as everyone knows, was formed out of\\r\\nmatter much lighter than our earth; and is, so we should say, as soft\\r\\nas newly-fallen snow. He found himself on one of the many circumjacent\\r\\nmountain-ridges with which we are acquainted by means of Dr. Madler's\\r\\n“Map of the Moon.” Within, down it sunk perpendicularly into a caldron,\\r\\nabout a Danish mile in depth; while below lay a town, whose appearance\\r\\nwe can, in some measure, realize to ourselves by beating the white of\\r\\nan egg in a glass of water. The matter of which it was built was just as\\r\\nsoft, and formed similar towers, and domes, and pillars, transparent and\\r\\nrocking in the thin air; while above his head our earth was rolling like\\r\\na large fiery ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe perceived immediately a quantity of beings who were certainly what\\r\\nwe call “men”; yet they looked different to us. A far more correct\\r\\nimagination than that of the pseudo-Herschel* had created them; and\\r\\nif they had been placed in rank and file, and copied by some skilful\\r\\npainter's hand, one would, without doubt, have exclaimed involuntarily,\\r\\n“What a beautiful arabesque!”\\r\\n\\r\\n*This relates to a book published some years ago in Germany, and said\\r\\nto be by Herschel, which contained a description of the moon and its\\r\\ninhabitants, written with such a semblance of truth that many were\\r\\ndeceived by the imposture.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably a translation of the celebrated Moon hoax, written by Richard\\r\\nA. Locke, and originally published in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had a language too; but surely nobody can expect that the soul of\\r\\nthe watchman should understand it. Be that as it may, it did comprehend\\r\\nit; for in our souls there germinate far greater powers than we poor\\r\\nmortals, despite all our cleverness, have any notion of. Does she\\r\\nnot show us--she the queen in the land of enchantment--her astounding\\r\\ndramatic talent in all our dreams? There every acquaintance appears and\\r\\nspeaks upon the stage, so entirely in character, and with the same tone\\r\\nof voice, that none of us, when awake, were able to imitate it. How\\r\\nwell can she recall persons to our mind, of whom we have not thought for\\r\\nyears; when suddenly they step forth “every inch a man,” resembling the\\r\\nreal personages, even to the finest features, and become the heroes\\r\\nor heroines of our world of dreams. In reality, such remembrances are\\r\\nrather unpleasant: every sin, every evil thought, may, like a clock with\\r\\nalarm or chimes, be repeated at pleasure; then the question is if we can\\r\\ntrust ourselves to give an account of every unbecoming word in our heart\\r\\nand on our lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe watchman's spirit understood the language of the inhabitants of the\\r\\nmoon pretty well. The Selenites* disputed variously about our earth,\\r\\nand expressed their doubts if it could be inhabited: the air, they said,\\r\\nmust certainly be too dense to allow any rational dweller in the moon\\r\\nthe necessary free respiration. They considered the moon alone to\\r\\nbe inhabited: they imagined it was the real heart of the universe or\\r\\nplanetary system, on which the genuine Cosmopolites, or citizens of the\\r\\nworld, dwelt. What strange things men--no, what strange things Selenites\\r\\nsometimes take into their heads!\\r\\n\\r\\n* Dwellers in the moon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout politics they had a good deal to say. But little Denmark must\\r\\ntake care what it is about, and not run counter to the moon; that\\r\\ngreat realm, that might in an ill-humor bestir itself, and dash down a\\r\\nhail-storm in our faces, or force the Baltic to overflow the sides of\\r\\nits gigantic basin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will, therefore, not listen to what was spoken, and on no condition\\r\\nrun in the possibility of telling tales out of school; but we will\\r\\nrather proceed, like good quiet citizens, to East Street, and observe\\r\\nwhat happened meanwhile to the body of the watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat lifeless on the steps: the morning-star,* that is to say, the\\r\\nheavy wooden staff, headed with iron spikes, and which had nothing else\\r\\nin common with its sparkling brother in the sky, had glided from his\\r\\nhand; while his eyes were fixed with glassy stare on the moon, looking\\r\\nfor the good old fellow of a spirit which still haunted it.\\r\\n\\r\\n*The watchmen in Germany, had formerly, and in some places they still\\r\\ncarry with them, on their rounds at night, a sort of mace or club, known\\r\\nin ancient times by the above denomination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What's the hour, watchman?” asked a passer-by. But when the watchman\\r\\ngave no reply, the merry roysterer, who was now returning home from a\\r\\nnoisy drinking bout, took it into his head to try what a tweak of the\\r\\nnose would do, on which the supposed sleeper lost his balance, the body\\r\\nlay motionless, stretched out on the pavement: the man was dead. When\\r\\nthe patrol came up, all his comrades, who comprehended nothing of the\\r\\nwhole affair, were seized with a dreadful fright, for dead he was,\\r\\nand he remained so. The proper authorities were informed of the\\r\\ncircumstance, people talked a good deal about it, and in the morning the\\r\\nbody was carried to the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that would be a very pretty joke, if the spirit when it came back\\r\\nand looked for the body in East Street, were not to find one. No doubt\\r\\nit would, in its anxiety, run off to the police, and then to the\\r\\n“Hue and Cry” office, to announce that “the finder will be handsomely\\r\\nrewarded,” and at last away to the hospital; yet we may boldly assert\\r\\nthat the soul is shrewdest when it shakes off every fetter, and every\\r\\nsort of leading-string--the body only makes it stupid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seemingly dead body of the watchman wandered, as we have said, to\\r\\nthe hospital, where it was brought into the general viewing-room:\\r\\nand the first thing that was done here was naturally to pull off the\\r\\ngaloshes--when the spirit, that was merely gone out on adventures, must\\r\\nhave returned with the quickness of lightning to its earthly tenement.\\r\\nIt took its direction towards the body in a straight line; and a few\\r\\nseconds after, life began to show itself in the man. He asserted that\\r\\nthe preceding night had been the worst that ever the malice of fate had\\r\\nallotted him; he would not for two silver marks again go through what he\\r\\nhad endured while moon-stricken; but now, however, it was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same day he was discharged from the hospital as perfectly cured; but\\r\\nthe Shoes meanwhile remained behind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV. A Moment of Head Importance--An Evening's “Dramatic Readings”--A\\r\\nMost Strange Journey\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery inhabitant of Copenhagen knows, from personal inspection, how\\r\\nthe entrance to Frederick's Hospital looks; but as it is possible that\\r\\nothers, who are not Copenhagen people, may also read this little work,\\r\\nwe will beforehand give a short description of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extensive building is separated from the street by a pretty high\\r\\nrailing, the thick iron bars of which are so far apart, that in\\r\\nall seriousness, it is said, some very thin fellow had of a night\\r\\noccasionally squeezed himself through to go and pay his little visits\\r\\nin the town. The part of the body most difficult to manage on such\\r\\noccasions was, no doubt, the head; here, as is so often the case in\\r\\nthe world, long-headed people get through best. So much, then, for the\\r\\nintroduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the young men, whose head, in a physical sense only, might be\\r\\nsaid to be of the thickest, had the watch that evening. The rain poured\\r\\ndown in torrents; yet despite these two obstacles, the young man was\\r\\nobliged to go out, if it were but for a quarter of an hour; and as\\r\\nto telling the door-keeper about it, that, he thought, was quite\\r\\nunnecessary, if, with a whole skin, he were able to slip through the\\r\\nrailings. There, on the floor lay the galoshes, which the watchman\\r\\nhad forgotten; he never dreamed for a moment that they were those of\\r\\nFortune; and they promised to do him good service in the wet; so he put\\r\\nthem on. The question now was, if he could squeeze himself through the\\r\\ngrating, for he had never tried before. Well, there he stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would to Heaven I had got my head through!” said he, involuntarily; and\\r\\ninstantly through it slipped, easily and without pain, notwithstanding\\r\\nit was pretty large and thick. But now the rest of the body was to be\\r\\ngot through!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! I am much too stout,” groaned he aloud, while fixed as in a vice.\\r\\n“I had thought the head was the most difficult part of the matter--oh!\\r\\noh! I really cannot squeeze myself through!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now wanted to pull his over-hasty head back again, but he could not.\\r\\nFor his neck there was room enough, but for nothing more. His first\\r\\nfeeling was of anger; his next that his temper fell to zero. The\\r\\nShoes of Fortune had placed him in the most dreadful situation; and,\\r\\nunfortunately, it never occurred to him to wish himself free. The\\r\\npitch-black clouds poured down their contents in still heavier torrents;\\r\\nnot a creature was to be seen in the streets. To reach up to the bell\\r\\nwas what he did not like; to cry aloud for help would have availed him\\r\\nlittle; besides, how ashamed would he have been to be found caught in a\\r\\ntrap, like an outwitted fox! How was he to twist himself through! He saw\\r\\nclearly that it was his irrevocable destiny to remain a prisoner till\\r\\ndawn, or, perhaps, even late in the morning; then the smith must be\\r\\nfetched to file away the bars; but all that would not be done so quickly\\r\\nas he could think about it. The whole Charity School, just opposite,\\r\\nwould be in motion; all the new booths, with their not very\\r\\ncourtier-like swarm of seamen, would join them out of curiosity, and\\r\\nwould greet him with a wild “hurrah!” while he was standing in his\\r\\npillory: there would be a mob, a hissing, and rejoicing, and jeering,\\r\\nten times worse than in the rows about the Jews some years ago--“Oh, my\\r\\nblood is mounting to my brain; 'tis enough to drive one mad! I shall go\\r\\nwild! I know not what to do. Oh! were I but loose; my dizziness would\\r\\nthen cease; oh, were my head but loose!”\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see he ought to have said that sooner; for the moment he expressed\\r\\nthe wish his head was free; and cured of all his paroxysms of love, he\\r\\nhastened off to his room, where the pains consequent on the fright the\\r\\nShoes had prepared for him, did not so soon take their leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you must not think that the affair is over now; it grows much worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night passed, the next day also; but nobody came to fetch the Shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening “Dramatic Readings” were to be given at the little\\r\\ntheatre in King Street. The house was filled to suffocation; and among\\r\\nother pieces to be recited was a new poem by H. C. Andersen, called, My\\r\\nAunt's Spectacles; the contents of which were pretty nearly as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n“A certain person had an aunt, who boasted of particular skill in\\r\\nfortune-telling with cards, and who was constantly being stormed by\\r\\npersons that wanted to have a peep into futurity. But she was full of\\r\\nmystery about her art, in which a certain pair of magic spectacles\\r\\ndid her essential service. Her nephew, a merry boy, who was his aunt's\\r\\ndarling, begged so long for these spectacles, that, at last, she lent\\r\\nhim the treasure, after having informed him, with many exhortations,\\r\\nthat in order to execute the interesting trick, he need only repair to\\r\\nsome place where a great many persons were assembled; and then, from a\\r\\nhigher position, whence he could overlook the crowd, pass the company in\\r\\nreview before him through his spectacles. Immediately 'the inner man' of\\r\\neach individual would be displayed before him, like a game of cards, in\\r\\nwhich he unerringly might read what the future of every person presented\\r\\nwas to be. Well pleased the little magician hastened away to prove the\\r\\npowers of the spectacles in the theatre; no place seeming to him more\\r\\nfitted for such a trial. He begged permission of the worthy audience,\\r\\nand set his spectacles on his nose. A motley phantasmagoria presents\\r\\nitself before him, which he describes in a few satirical touches, yet\\r\\nwithout expressing his opinion openly: he tells the people enough to set\\r\\nthem all thinking and guessing; but in order to hurt nobody, he wraps\\r\\nhis witty oracular judgments in a transparent veil, or rather in a lurid\\r\\nthundercloud, shooting forth bright sparks of wit, that they may fall in\\r\\nthe powder-magazine of the expectant audience.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe humorous poem was admirably recited, and the speaker much applauded.\\r\\nAmong the audience was the young man of the hospital, who seemed to have\\r\\nforgotten his adventure of the preceding night. He had on the Shoes; for\\r\\nas yet no lawful owner had appeared to claim them; and besides it was so\\r\\nvery dirty out-of-doors, they were just the thing for him, he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beginning of the poem he praised with great generosity: he even\\r\\nfound the idea original and effective. But that the end of it, like the\\r\\nRhine, was very insignificant, proved, in his opinion, the author's\\r\\nwant of invention; he was without genius, etc. This was an excellent\\r\\nopportunity to have said something clever.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile he was haunted by the idea--he should like to possess such a\\r\\npair of spectacles himself; then, perhaps, by using them circumspectly,\\r\\none would be able to look into people's hearts, which, he thought, would\\r\\nbe far more interesting than merely to see what was to happen next year;\\r\\nfor that we should all know in proper time, but the other never.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can now,” said he to himself, “fancy the whole row of ladies and\\r\\ngentlemen sitting there in the front row; if one could but see into\\r\\ntheir hearts--yes, that would be a revelation--a sort of bazar. In that\\r\\nlady yonder, so strangely dressed, I should find for certain a large\\r\\nmilliner's shop; in that one the shop is empty, but it wants cleaning\\r\\nplain enough. But there would also be some good stately shops among\\r\\nthem. Alas!” sighed he, “I know one in which all is stately; but there\\r\\nsits already a spruce young shopman, which is the only thing that's\\r\\namiss in the whole shop. All would be splendidly decked out, and we\\r\\nshould hear, 'Walk in, gentlemen, pray walk in; here you will find all\\r\\nyou please to want.' Ah! I wish to Heaven I could walk in and take a\\r\\ntrip right through the hearts of those present!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd behold! to the Shoes of Fortune this was the cue; the whole man\\r\\nshrunk together and a most uncommon journey through the hearts of the\\r\\nfront row of spectators, now began. The first heart through which he\\r\\ncame, was that of a middle-aged lady, but he instantly fancied himself\\r\\nin the room of the “Institution for the cure of the crooked and\\r\\ndeformed,” where casts of mis-shapen limbs are displayed in naked\\r\\nreality on the wall. Yet there was this difference, in the institution\\r\\nthe casts were taken at the entry of the patient; but here they were\\r\\nretained and guarded in the heart while the sound persons went away.\\r\\nThey were, namely, casts of female friends, whose bodily or mental\\r\\ndeformities were here most faithfully preserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the snake-like writhings of an idea he glided into another female\\r\\nheart; but this seemed to him like a large holy fane. [*] The white dove of\\r\\ninnocence fluttered over the altar. How gladly would he have sunk upon\\r\\nhis knees; but he must away to the next heart; yet he still heard the\\r\\npealing tones of the organ, and he himself seemed to have become a newer\\r\\nand a better man; he felt unworthy to tread the neighboring sanctuary\\r\\nwhich a poor garret, with a sick bed-rid mother, revealed. But God's\\r\\nwarm sun streamed through the open window; lovely roses nodded from\\r\\nthe wooden flower-boxes on the roof, and two sky-blue birds sang\\r\\nrejoicingly, while the sick mother implored God's richest blessings on\\r\\nher pious daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * temple\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now crept on hands and feet through a butcher's shop; at least on\\r\\nevery side, and above and below, there was nought but flesh. It was the\\r\\nheart of a most respectable rich man, whose name is certain to be found\\r\\nin the Directory.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was now in the heart of the wife of this worthy gentleman. It was an\\r\\nold, dilapidated, mouldering dovecot. The husband's portrait was used as\\r\\na weather-cock, which was connected in some way or other with the doors,\\r\\nand so they opened and shut of their own accord, whenever the stern old\\r\\nhusband turned round.\\r\\n\\r\\nHereupon he wandered into a boudoir formed entirely of mirrors, like\\r\\nthe one in Castle Rosenburg; but here the glasses magnified to an\\r\\nastonishing degree. On the floor, in the middle of the room, sat, like a\\r\\nDalai-Lama, the insignificant “Self” of the person, quite confounded at\\r\\nhis own greatness. He then imagined he had got into a needle-case full\\r\\nof pointed needles of every size.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is certainly the heart of an old maid,” thought he. But he was\\r\\nmistaken. It was the heart of a young military man; a man, as people\\r\\nsaid, of talent and feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the greatest perplexity, he now came out of the last heart in the\\r\\nrow; he was unable to put his thoughts in order, and fancied that his\\r\\ntoo lively imagination had run away with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Heavens!” sighed he. “I have surely a disposition to madness--'tis\\r\\ndreadfully hot here; my blood boils in my veins and my head is burning\\r\\nlike a coal.” And he now remembered the important event of the evening\\r\\nbefore, how his head had got jammed in between the iron railings of the\\r\\nhospital. “That's what it is, no doubt,” said he. “I must do something\\r\\nin time: under such circumstances a Russian bath might do me good. I\\r\\nonly wish I were already on the upper bank.” [*]\\r\\n\\r\\n     *In these Russian (vapor) baths the person extends himself\\r\\n     on a bank or form, and as he gets accustomed to the heat,\\r\\n     moves to another higher up towards the ceiling, where, of\\r\\n     course, the vapor is warmest. In this manner he ascends\\r\\n     gradually to the highest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so there he lay on the uppermost bank in the vapor-bath; but with\\r\\nall his clothes on, in his boots and galoshes, while the hot drops fell\\r\\nscalding from the ceiling on his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holloa!” cried he, leaping down. The bathing attendant, on his side,\\r\\nuttered a loud cry of astonishment when he beheld in the bath, a man\\r\\ncompletely dressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other, however, retained sufficient presence of mind to whisper to\\r\\nhim, “'Tis a bet, and I have won it!” But the first thing he did as soon\\r\\nas he got home, was to have a large blister put on his chest and back to\\r\\ndraw out his madness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning he had a sore chest and a bleeding back; and, excepting\\r\\nthe fright, that was all that he had gained by the Shoes of Fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV. Metamorphosis of the Copying-Clerk\\r\\n\\r\\nThe watchman, whom we have certainly not forgotten, thought meanwhile\\r\\nof the galoshes he had found and taken with him to the hospital; he now\\r\\nwent to fetch them; and as neither the lieutenant, nor anybody else in\\r\\nthe street, claimed them as his property, they were delivered over to\\r\\nthe police-office.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*As on the continent, in all law and police practices nothing is verbal,\\r\\nbut any circumstance, however trifling, is reduced to writing, the\\r\\nlabor, as well as the number of papers that thus accumulate, is\\r\\nenormous. In a police-office, consequently, we find copying-clerks among\\r\\nmany other scribes of various denominations, of which, it seems, our\\r\\nhero was one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, I declare the Shoes look just like my own,” said one of the\\r\\nclerks, eying the newly-found treasure, whose hidden powers, even he,\\r\\nsharp as he was, was not able to discover. “One must have more than\\r\\nthe eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the other,” said he,\\r\\nsoliloquizing; and putting, at the same time, the galoshes in search of\\r\\nan owner, beside his own in the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here, sir!” said one of the men, who panting brought him a tremendous\\r\\npile of papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe copying-clerk turned round and spoke awhile with the man about the\\r\\nreports and legal documents in question; but when he had finished, and\\r\\nhis eye fell again on the Shoes, he was unable to say whether those to\\r\\nthe left or those to the right belonged to him. “At all events it must\\r\\nbe those which are wet,” thought he; but this time, in spite of his\\r\\ncleverness, he guessed quite wrong, for it was just those of Fortune\\r\\nwhich played as it were into his hands, or rather on his feet. And why,\\r\\nI should like to know, are the police never to be wrong? So he put them\\r\\non quickly, stuck his papers in his pocket, and took besides a few under\\r\\nhis arm, intending to look them through at home to make the necessary\\r\\nnotes. It was noon; and the weather, that had threatened rain, began\\r\\nto clear up, while gaily dressed holiday folks filled the streets. “A\\r\\nlittle trip to Fredericksburg would do me no great harm,” thought he;\\r\\n“for I, poor beast of burden that I am, have so much to annoy me, that I\\r\\ndon't know what a good appetite is. 'Tis a bitter crust, alas! at which\\r\\nI am condemned to gnaw!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody could be more steady or quiet than this young man; we therefore\\r\\nwish him joy of the excursion with all our heart; and it will certainly\\r\\nbe beneficial for a person who leads so sedentary a life. In the park\\r\\nhe met a friend, one of our young poets, who told him that the following\\r\\nday he should set out on his long-intended tour.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you are going away again!” said the clerk. “You are a very free\\r\\nand happy being; we others are chained by the leg and held fast to our\\r\\ndesk.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; but it is a chain, friend, which ensures you the blessed bread\\r\\nof existence,” answered the poet. “You need feel no care for the coming\\r\\nmorrow: when you are old, you receive a pension.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“True,” said the clerk, shrugging his shoulders; “and yet you are\\r\\nthe better off. To sit at one's ease and poetise--that is a pleasure;\\r\\neverybody has something agreeable to say to you, and you are always your\\r\\nown master. No, friend, you should but try what it is to sit from one\\r\\nyear's end to the other occupied with and judging the most trivial\\r\\nmatters.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet shook his head, the copying-clerk did the same. Each one kept\\r\\nto his own opinion, and so they separated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It's a strange race, those poets!” said the clerk, who was very fond of\\r\\nsoliloquizing. “I should like some day, just for a trial, to take such\\r\\nnature upon me, and be a poet myself; I am very sure I should make\\r\\nno such miserable verses as the others. Today, methinks, is a most\\r\\ndelicious day for a poet. Nature seems anew to celebrate her awakening\\r\\ninto life. The air is so unusually clear, the clouds sail on so\\r\\nbuoyantly, and from the green herbage a fragrance is exhaled that fills\\r\\nme with delight. For many a year have I not felt as at this moment.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see already, by the foregoing effusion, that he is become a poet; to\\r\\ngive further proof of it, however, would in most cases be insipid, for\\r\\nit is a most foolish notion to fancy a poet different from other men.\\r\\nAmong the latter there may be far more poetical natures than many an\\r\\nacknowledged poet, when examined more closely, could boast of; the\\r\\ndifference only is, that the poet possesses a better mental memory, on\\r\\nwhich account he is able to retain the feeling and the thought till they\\r\\ncan be embodied by means of words; a faculty which the others do not\\r\\npossess. But the transition from a commonplace nature to one that is\\r\\nrichly endowed, demands always a more or less breakneck leap over a\\r\\ncertain abyss which yawns threateningly below; and thus must the sudden\\r\\nchange with the clerk strike the reader.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The sweet air!” continued he of the police-office, in his dreamy\\r\\nimaginings; “how it reminds me of the violets in the garden of my aunt\\r\\nMagdalena! Yes, then I was a little wild boy, who did not go to school\\r\\nvery regularly. O heavens! 'tis a long time since I have thought on\\r\\nthose times. The good old soul! She lived behind the Exchange. She\\r\\nalways had a few twigs or green shoots in water--let the winter rage\\r\\nwithout as it might. The violets exhaled their sweet breath, whilst I\\r\\npressed against the windowpanes covered with fantastic frost-work the\\r\\ncopper coin I had heated on the stove, and so made peep-holes.\\r\\nWhat splendid vistas were then opened to my view! What change--what\\r\\nmagnificence! Yonder in the canal lay the ships frozen up, and deserted\\r\\nby their whole crews, with a screaming crow for the sole occupant. But\\r\\nwhen the spring, with a gentle stirring motion, announced her arrival,\\r\\na new and busy life arose; with songs and hurrahs the ice was sawn\\r\\nasunder, the ships were fresh tarred and rigged, that they might sail\\r\\naway to distant lands. But I have remained here--must always remain\\r\\nhere, sitting at my desk in the office, and patiently see other people\\r\\nfetch their passports to go abroad. Such is my fate! Alas!”--sighed he,\\r\\nand was again silent. “Great Heaven! What is come to me! Never have I\\r\\nthought or felt like this before! It must be the summer air that affects\\r\\nme with feelings almost as disquieting as they are refreshing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt in his pocket for the papers. “These police-reports will soon\\r\\nstem the torrent of my ideas, and effectually hinder any rebellious\\r\\noverflowing of the time-worn banks of official duties”; he said to\\r\\nhimself consolingly, while his eye ran over the first page. “DAME\\r\\nTIGBRITH, tragedy in five acts.” “What is that? And yet it is undeniably\\r\\nmy own handwriting. Have I written the tragedy? Wonderful, very\\r\\nwonderful!--And this--what have I here? 'INTRIGUE ON THE RAMPARTS; or\\r\\nTHE DAY OF REPENTANCE: vaudeville with new songs to the most favorite\\r\\nairs.' The deuce! Where did I get all this rubbish? Some one must have\\r\\nslipped it slyly into my pocket for a joke. There is too a letter to me;\\r\\na crumpled letter and the seal broken.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYes; it was not a very polite epistle from the manager of a theatre, in\\r\\nwhich both pieces were flatly refused.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hem! hem!” said the clerk breathlessly, and quite exhausted he seated\\r\\nhimself on a bank. His thoughts were so elastic, his heart so tender;\\r\\nand involuntarily he picked one of the nearest flowers. It is a simple\\r\\ndaisy, just bursting out of the bud. What the botanist tells us after\\r\\na number of imperfect lectures, the flower proclaimed in a minute. It\\r\\nrelated the mythus of its birth, told of the power of the sun-light that\\r\\nspread out its delicate leaves, and forced them to impregnate the air\\r\\nwith their incense--and then he thought of the manifold struggles of\\r\\nlife, which in like manner awaken the budding flowers of feeling in our\\r\\nbosom. Light and air contend with chivalric emulation for the love of\\r\\nthe fair flower that bestowed her chief favors on the latter; full of\\r\\nlonging she turned towards the light, and as soon as it vanished, rolled\\r\\nher tender leaves together and slept in the embraces of the air. “It is\\r\\nthe light which adorns me,” said the flower.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But 'tis the air which enables thee to breathe,” said the poet's voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nClose by stood a boy who dashed his stick into a wet ditch. The drops of\\r\\nwater splashed up to the green leafy roof, and the clerk thought of the\\r\\nmillion of ephemera which in a single drop were thrown up to a height,\\r\\nthat was as great doubtless for their size, as for us if we were to\\r\\nbe hurled above the clouds. While he thought of this and of the whole\\r\\nmetamorphosis he had undergone, he smiled and said, “I sleep and dream;\\r\\nbut it is wonderful how one can dream so naturally, and know besides so\\r\\nexactly that it is but a dream. If only to-morrow on awaking, I could\\r\\nagain call all to mind so vividly! I seem in unusually good spirits; my\\r\\nperception of things is clear, I feel as light and cheerful as though\\r\\nI were in heaven; but I know for a certainty, that if to-morrow a dim\\r\\nremembrance of it should swim before my mind, it will then seem nothing\\r\\nbut stupid nonsense, as I have often experienced already--especially\\r\\nbefore I enlisted under the banner of the police, for that dispels like\\r\\na whirlwind all the visions of an unfettered imagination. All we hear\\r\\nor say in a dream that is fair and beautiful is like the gold of the\\r\\nsubterranean spirits; it is rich and splendid when it is given us, but\\r\\nviewed by daylight we find only withered leaves. Alas!” he sighed quite\\r\\nsorrowful, and gazed at the chirping birds that hopped contentedly from\\r\\nbranch to branch, “they are much better off than I! To fly must be a\\r\\nheavenly art; and happy do I prize that creature in which it is innate.\\r\\nYes! Could I exchange my nature with any other creature, I fain would be\\r\\nsuch a happy little lark!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly uttered these hasty words when the skirts and sleeves\\r\\nof his coat folded themselves together into wings; the clothes became\\r\\nfeathers, and the galoshes claws. He observed it perfectly, and laughed\\r\\nin his heart. “Now then, there is no doubt that I am dreaming; but I\\r\\nnever before was aware of such mad freaks as these.” And up he flew into\\r\\nthe green roof and sang; but in the song there was no poetry, for the\\r\\nspirit of the poet was gone. The Shoes, as is the case with anybody who\\r\\ndoes what he has to do properly, could only attend to one thing at a\\r\\ntime. He wanted to be a poet, and he was one; he now wished to be a\\r\\nmerry chirping bird: but when he was metamorphosed into one, the former\\r\\npeculiarities ceased immediately. “It is really pleasant enough,” said\\r\\nhe: “the whole day long I sit in the office amid the driest\\r\\nlaw-papers, and at night I fly in my dream as a lark in the gardens of\\r\\nFredericksburg; one might really write a very pretty comedy upon it.” He\\r\\nnow fluttered down into the grass, turned his head gracefully on every\\r\\nside, and with his bill pecked the pliant blades of grass, which, in\\r\\ncomparison to his present size, seemed as majestic as the palm-branches\\r\\nof northern Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately the pleasure lasted but a moment. Presently black night\\r\\novershadowed our enthusiast, who had so entirely missed his part of\\r\\ncopying-clerk at a police-office; some vast object seemed to be thrown\\r\\nover him. It was a large oil-skin cap, which a sailor-boy of the quay\\r\\nhad thrown over the struggling bird; a coarse hand sought its way\\r\\ncarefully in under the broad rim, and seized the clerk over the back\\r\\nand wings. In the first moment of fear, he called, indeed, as loud as\\r\\nhe could--“You impudent little blackguard! I am a copying-clerk at\\r\\nthe police-office; and you know you cannot insult any belonging to the\\r\\nconstabulary force without a chastisement. Besides, you good-for-nothing\\r\\nrascal, it is strictly forbidden to catch birds in the royal gardens of\\r\\nFredericksburg; but your blue uniform betrays where you come from.”\\r\\n This fine tirade sounded, however, to the ungodly sailor-boy like a mere\\r\\n“Pippi-pi.” He gave the noisy bird a knock on his beak, and walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was soon met by two schoolboys of the upper class--that is to say as\\r\\nindividuals, for with regard to learning they were in the lowest class\\r\\nin the school; and they bought the stupid bird. So the copying-clerk\\r\\ncame to Copenhagen as guest, or rather as prisoner in a family living in\\r\\nGother Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis well that I'm dreaming,” said the clerk, “or I really should get\\r\\nangry. First I was a poet; now sold for a few pence as a lark; no doubt\\r\\nit was that accursed poetical nature which has metamorphosed me\\r\\ninto such a poor harmless little creature. It is really pitiable,\\r\\nparticularly when one gets into the hands of a little blackguard,\\r\\nperfect in all sorts of cruelty to animals: all I should like to know\\r\\nis, how the story will end.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two schoolboys, the proprietors now of the transformed clerk,\\r\\ncarried him into an elegant room. A stout stately dame received them\\r\\nwith a smile; but she expressed much dissatisfaction that a common\\r\\nfield-bird, as she called the lark, should appear in such high society.\\r\\nFor to-day, however, she would allow it; and they must shut him in the\\r\\nempty cage that was standing in the window. “Perhaps he will amuse my\\r\\ngood Polly,” added the lady, looking with a benignant smile at a large\\r\\ngreen parrot that swung himself backwards and forwards most comfortably\\r\\nin his ring, inside a magnificent brass-wired cage. “To-day is Polly's\\r\\nbirthday,” said she with stupid simplicity: “and the little brown\\r\\nfield-bird must wish him joy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Polly uttered not a syllable in reply, but swung to and fro with\\r\\ndignified condescension; while a pretty canary, as yellow as gold, that\\r\\nhad lately been brought from his sunny fragrant home, began to sing\\r\\naloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Noisy creature! Will you be quiet!” screamed the lady of the house,\\r\\ncovering the cage with an embroidered white pocket handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Chirp, chirp!” sighed he. “That was a dreadful snowstorm”; and he\\r\\nsighed again, and was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe copying-clerk, or, as the lady said, the brown field-bird, was\\r\\nput into a small cage, close to the Canary, and not far from “my good\\r\\nPolly.” The only human sounds that the Parrot could bawl out\\r\\nwere, “Come, let us be men!” Everything else that he said was as\\r\\nunintelligible to everybody as the chirping of the Canary, except to the\\r\\nclerk, who was now a bird too: he understood his companion perfectly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I flew about beneath the green palms and the blossoming almond-trees,”\\r\\n sang the Canary; “I flew around, with my brothers and sisters, over\\r\\nthe beautiful flowers, and over the glassy lakes, where the bright\\r\\nwater-plants nodded to me from below. There, too, I saw many\\r\\nsplendidly-dressed paroquets, that told the drollest stories, and the\\r\\nwildest fairy tales without end.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! those were uncouth birds,” answered the Parrot. “They had no\\r\\neducation, and talked of whatever came into their head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If my mistress and all her friends can laugh at what I say, so may you\\r\\ntoo, I should think. It is a great fault to have no taste for what is\\r\\nwitty or amusing--come, let us be men.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you have no remembrance of love for the charming maidens that\\r\\ndanced beneath the outspread tents beside the bright fragrant flowers?\\r\\nDo you no longer remember the sweet fruits, and the cooling juice in\\r\\nthe wild plants of our never-to-be-forgotten home?” said the former\\r\\ninhabitant of the Canary Isles, continuing his dithyrambic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes,” said the Parrot; “but I am far better off here. I am well\\r\\nfed, and get friendly treatment. I know I am a clever fellow; and that\\r\\nis all I care about. Come, let us be men. You are of a poetical nature,\\r\\nas it is called--I, on the contrary, possess profound knowledge and\\r\\ninexhaustible wit. You have genius; but clear-sighted, calm discretion\\r\\ndoes not take such lofty flights, and utter such high natural tones.\\r\\nFor this they have covered you over--they never do the like to me; for\\r\\nI cost more. Besides, they are afraid of my beak; and I have always a\\r\\nwitty answer at hand. Come, let us be men!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“O warm spicy land of my birth,” sang the Canary bird; “I will sing of\\r\\nthy dark-green bowers, of the calm bays where the pendent boughs\\r\\nkiss the surface of the water; I will sing of the rejoicing of all my\\r\\nbrothers and sisters where the cactus grows in wanton luxuriance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Spare us your elegiac tones,” said the Parrot giggling. “Rather speak\\r\\nof something at which one may laugh heartily. Laughing is an infallible\\r\\nsign of the highest degree of mental development. Can a dog, or a horse\\r\\nlaugh? No, but they can cry. The gift of laughing was given to man\\r\\nalone. Ha! ha! ha!” screamed Polly, and added his stereotype witticism.\\r\\n“Come, let us be men!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor little Danish grey-bird,” said the Canary; “you have been caught\\r\\ntoo. It is, no doubt, cold enough in your woods, but there at least\\r\\nis the breath of liberty; therefore fly away. In the hurry they have\\r\\nforgotten to shut your cage, and the upper window is open. Fly, my\\r\\nfriend; fly away. Farewell!”\\r\\n\\r\\nInstinctively the Clerk obeyed; with a few strokes of his wings he was\\r\\nout of the cage; but at the same moment the door, which was only ajar,\\r\\nand which led to the next room, began to creak, and supple and creeping\\r\\ncame the large tomcat into the room, and began to pursue him. The\\r\\nfrightened Canary fluttered about in his cage; the Parrot flapped his\\r\\nwings, and cried, “Come, let us be men!” The Clerk felt a mortal fright,\\r\\nand flew through the window, far away over the houses and streets. At\\r\\nlast he was forced to rest a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighboring house had a something familiar about it; a window stood\\r\\nopen; he flew in; it was his own room. He perched upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, let us be men!” said he, involuntarily imitating the chatter of\\r\\nthe Parrot, and at the same moment he was again a copying-clerk; but he\\r\\nwas sitting in the middle of the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Heaven help me!” cried he. “How did I get up here--and so buried in\\r\\nsleep, too? After all, that was a very unpleasant, disagreeable dream\\r\\nthat haunted me! The whole story is nothing but silly, stupid nonsense!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI. The Best That the Galoshes Gave\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day, early in the morning, while the Clerk was still in\\r\\nbed, someone knocked at his door. It was his neighbor, a young Divine,\\r\\nwho lived on the same floor. He walked in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lend me your Galoshes,” said he; “it is so wet in the garden, though\\r\\nthe sun is shining most invitingly. I should like to go out a little.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got the Galoshes, and he was soon below in a little duodecimo garden,\\r\\nwhere between two immense walls a plumtree and an apple-tree were\\r\\nstanding. Even such a little garden as this was considered in the\\r\\nmetropolis of Copenhagen as a great luxury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man wandered up and down the narrow paths, as well as the\\r\\nprescribed limits would allow; the clock struck six; without was heard\\r\\nthe horn of a post-boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To travel! to travel!” exclaimed he, overcome by most painful and\\r\\npassionate remembrances. “That is the happiest thing in the world! That\\r\\nis the highest aim of all my wishes! Then at last would the agonizing\\r\\nrestlessness be allayed, which destroys my existence! But it must be\\r\\nfar, far away! I would behold magnificent Switzerland; I would travel to\\r\\nItaly, and--”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a good thing that the power of the Galoshes worked as\\r\\ninstantaneously as lightning in a powder-magazine would do, otherwise\\r\\nthe poor man with his overstrained wishes would have travelled about\\r\\nthe world too much for himself as well as for us. In short, he was\\r\\ntravelling. He was in the middle of Switzerland, but packed up with\\r\\neight other passengers in the inside of an eternally-creaking diligence;\\r\\nhis head ached till it almost split, his weary neck could hardly bear\\r\\nthe heavy load, and his feet, pinched by his torturing boots, were\\r\\nterribly swollen. He was in an intermediate state between sleeping and\\r\\nwaking; at variance with himself, with his company, with the country,\\r\\nand with the government. In his right pocket he had his letter of\\r\\ncredit, in the left, his passport, and in a small leathern purse some\\r\\ndouble louis d'or, carefully sewn up in the bosom of his waistcoat.\\r\\nEvery dream proclaimed that one or the other of these valuables was\\r\\nlost; wherefore he started up as in a fever; and the first movement\\r\\nwhich his hand made, described a magic triangle from the right pocket to\\r\\nthe left, and then up towards the bosom, to feel if he had them all safe\\r\\nor not. From the roof inside the carriage, umbrellas, walking-sticks,\\r\\nhats, and sundry other articles were depending, and hindered the view,\\r\\nwhich was particularly imposing. He now endeavored as well as he\\r\\nwas able to dispel his gloom, which was caused by outward chance\\r\\ncircumstances merely, and on the bosom of nature imbibe the milk of\\r\\npurest human enjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand, solemn, and dark was the whole landscape around. The gigantic\\r\\npine-forests, on the pointed crags, seemed almost like little tufts of\\r\\nheather, colored by the surrounding clouds. It began to snow, a cold\\r\\nwind blew and roared as though it were seeking a bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Augh!” sighed he, “were we only on the other side the Alps, then we\\r\\nshould have summer, and I could get my letters of credit cashed. The\\r\\nanxiety I feel about them prevents me enjoying Switzerland. Were I but\\r\\non the other side!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying he was on the other side in Italy, between Florence and\\r\\nRome. Lake Thracymene, illumined by the evening sun, lay like flaming\\r\\ngold between the dark-blue mountain-ridges; here, where Hannibal\\r\\ndefeated Flaminius, the rivers now held each other in their green\\r\\nembraces; lovely, half-naked children tended a herd of black swine,\\r\\nbeneath a group of fragrant laurel-trees, hard by the road-side.\\r\\nCould we render this inimitable picture properly, then would everybody\\r\\nexclaim, “Beautiful, unparalleled Italy!” But neither the young Divine\\r\\nsaid so, nor anyone of his grumbling companions in the coach of the\\r\\nvetturino.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poisonous flies and gnats swarmed around by thousands; in vain one\\r\\nwaved myrtle-branches about like mad; the audacious insect population\\r\\ndid not cease to sting; nor was there a single person in the\\r\\nwell-crammed carriage whose face was not swollen and sore from their\\r\\nravenous bites. The poor horses, tortured almost to death, suffered most\\r\\nfrom this truly Egyptian plague; the flies alighted upon them in large\\r\\ndisgusting swarms; and if the coachman got down and scraped them off,\\r\\nhardly a minute elapsed before they were there again. The sun now set: a\\r\\nfreezing cold, though of short duration pervaded the whole creation;\\r\\nit was like a horrid gust coming from a burial-vault on a warm summer's\\r\\nday--but all around the mountains retained that wonderful green tone\\r\\nwhich we see in some old pictures, and which, should we not have seen a\\r\\nsimilar play of color in the South, we declare at once to be unnatural.\\r\\nIt was a glorious prospect; but the stomach was empty, the body tired;\\r\\nall that the heart cared and longed for was good night-quarters; yet\\r\\nhow would they be? For these one looked much more anxiously than for the\\r\\ncharms of nature, which every where were so profusely displayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road led through an olive-grove, and here the solitary inn was\\r\\nsituated. Ten or twelve crippled-beggars had encamped outside. The\\r\\nhealthiest of them resembled, to use an expression of Marryat's,\\r\\n“Hunger's eldest son when he had come of age”; the others were either\\r\\nblind, had withered legs and crept about on their hands, or withered\\r\\narms and fingerless hands. It was the most wretched misery, dragged\\r\\nfrom among the filthiest rags. “Excellenza, miserabili!” sighed they,\\r\\nthrusting forth their deformed limbs to view. Even the hostess, with\\r\\nbare feet, uncombed hair, and dressed in a garment of doubtful color,\\r\\nreceived the guests grumblingly. The doors were fastened with a loop of\\r\\nstring; the floor of the rooms presented a stone paving half torn\\r\\nup; bats fluttered wildly about the ceiling; and as to the smell\\r\\ntherein--no--that was beyond description.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better lay the cloth below in the stable,” said one of the\\r\\ntravellers; “there, at all events, one knows what one is breathing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe windows were quickly opened, to let in a little fresh air. Quicker,\\r\\nhowever, than the breeze, the withered, sallow arms of the beggars were\\r\\nthrust in, accompanied by the eternal whine of “Miserabili, miserabili,\\r\\nexcellenza!” On the walls were displayed innumerable inscriptions,\\r\\nwritten in nearly every language of Europe, some in verse, some in\\r\\nprose, most of them not very laudatory of “bella Italia.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meal was served. It consisted of a soup of salted water, seasoned\\r\\nwith pepper and rancid oil. The last ingredient played a very prominent\\r\\npart in the salad; stale eggs and roasted cocks'-combs furnished the\\r\\ngrand dish of the repast; the wine even was not without a disgusting\\r\\ntaste--it was like a medicinal draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night the boxes and other effects of the passengers were placed\\r\\nagainst the rickety doors. One of the travellers kept watch while the\\r\\nothers slept. The sentry was our young Divine. How close it was in the\\r\\nchamber! The heat oppressive to suffocation--the gnats hummed and stung\\r\\nunceasingly--the “miserabili” without whined and moaned in their sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Travelling would be agreeable enough,” said he groaning, “if one only\\r\\nhad no body, or could send it to rest while the spirit went on its\\r\\npilgrimage unhindered, whither the voice within might call it. Wherever\\r\\nI go, I am pursued by a longing that is insatiable--that I cannot\\r\\nexplain to myself, and that tears my very heart. I want something better\\r\\nthan what is but what is fled in an instant. But what is it, and where\\r\\nis it to be found? Yet, I know in reality what it is I wish for. Oh!\\r\\nmost happy were I, could I but reach one aim--could but reach the\\r\\nhappiest of all!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as he spoke the word he was again in his home; the long white\\r\\ncurtains hung down from the windows, and in the middle of the floor\\r\\nstood the black coffin; in it he lay in the sleep of death. His wish\\r\\nwas fulfilled--the body rested, while the spirit went unhindered on its\\r\\npilgrimage. “Let no one deem himself happy before his end,” were the\\r\\nwords of Solon; and here was a new and brilliant proof of the wisdom of\\r\\nthe old apothegm.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery corpse is a sphynx of immortality; here too on the black coffin\\r\\nthe sphynx gave us no answer to what he who lay within had written two\\r\\ndays before:\\r\\n\\r\\n     “O mighty Death! thy silence teaches nought,\\r\\n       Thou leadest only to the near grave's brink;\\r\\n      Is broken now the ladder of my thoughts?\\r\\n     Do I instead of mounting only sink?\\r\\n\\r\\n     Our heaviest grief the world oft seeth not,\\r\\n      Our sorest pain we hide from stranger eyes:\\r\\n      And for the sufferer there is nothing left\\r\\n     But the green mound that o'er the coffin lies.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo figures were moving in the chamber. We knew them both; it was the\\r\\nfairy of Care, and the emissary of Fortune. They both bent over the\\r\\ncorpse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you now see,” said Care, “what happiness your Galoshes have brought\\r\\nto mankind?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To him, at least, who slumbers here, they have brought an imperishable\\r\\nblessing,” answered the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah no!” replied Care. “He took his departure himself; he was not called\\r\\naway. His mental powers here below were not strong enough to reach the\\r\\ntreasures lying beyond this life, and which his destiny ordained he\\r\\nshould obtain. I will now confer a benefit on him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she took the Galoshes from his feet; his sleep of death was ended;\\r\\nand he who had been thus called back again to life arose from his\\r\\ndread couch in all the vigor of youth. Care vanished, and with her the\\r\\nGaloshes. She has no doubt taken them for herself, to keep them to all\\r\\neternity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIR TREE\\r\\n\\r\\nOut in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree. The place he had was a\\r\\nvery good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air, there was enough\\r\\nof that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as\\r\\nfirs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care\\r\\nfor the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they\\r\\nwere in the woods looking for wild-strawberries. The children often came\\r\\nwith a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on\\r\\na straw, and sat down near the young tree and said, “Oh, how pretty he\\r\\nis! What a nice little fir!” But this was what the Tree could not bear\\r\\nto hear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year\\r\\nhe was another long bit taller; for with fir trees one can always tell\\r\\nby the shoots how many years old they are.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! Were I but such a high tree as the others are,” sighed he. “Then I\\r\\nshould be able to spread out my branches, and with the tops to look into\\r\\nthe wide world! Then would the birds build nests among my branches: and\\r\\nwhen there was a breeze, I could bend with as much stateliness as the\\r\\nothers!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds which morning\\r\\nand evening sailed above him, gave the little Tree any pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare would\\r\\noften come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree. Oh, that\\r\\nmade him so angry! But two winters were past, and in the third the Tree\\r\\nwas so large that the hare was obliged to go round it. “To grow and\\r\\ngrow, to get older and be tall,” thought the Tree--“that, after all, is\\r\\nthe most delightful thing in the world!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest\\r\\ntrees. This happened every year; and the young Fir Tree, that had now\\r\\ngrown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificent\\r\\ngreat trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were\\r\\nlopped off, and the trees looked long and bare; they were hardly to be\\r\\nrecognised; and then they were laid in carts, and the horses dragged\\r\\nthem out of the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere did they go to? What became of them?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spring, when the swallows and the storks came, the Tree asked them,\\r\\n“Don't you know where they have been taken? Have you not met them\\r\\nanywhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork looked\\r\\nmusing, nodded his head, and said, “Yes; I think I know; I met many\\r\\nships as I was flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificent\\r\\nmasts, and I venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir.\\r\\nI may congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high most\\r\\nmajestically!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea! But how does the sea\\r\\nlook in reality? What is it like?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That would take a long time to explain,” said the Stork, and with these\\r\\nwords off he went.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rejoice in thy growth!” said the Sunbeams. “Rejoice in thy vigorous\\r\\ngrowth, and in the fresh life that moveth within thee!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but the\\r\\nFir understood it not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down: trees which often\\r\\nwere not even as large or of the same age as this Fir Tree, who could\\r\\nnever rest, but always wanted to be off. These young trees, and they\\r\\nwere always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laid\\r\\non carts, and the horses drew them out of the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are they going to?” asked the Fir. “They are not taller than\\r\\nI; there was one indeed that was considerably shorter; and why do they\\r\\nretain all their branches? Whither are they taken?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We know! We know!” chirped the Sparrows. “We have peeped in at the\\r\\nwindows in the town below! We know whither they are taken! The greatest\\r\\nsplendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them. We\\r\\npeeped through the windows, and saw them planted in the middle of the\\r\\nwarm room and ornamented with the most splendid things, with gilded\\r\\napples, with gingerbread, with toys, and many hundred lights!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And then?” asked the Fir Tree, trembling in every bough. “And then?\\r\\nWhat happens then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career,” cried\\r\\nthe Tree, rejoicing. “That is still better than to cross the sea! What\\r\\na longing do I suffer! Were Christmas but come! I am now tall, and my\\r\\nbranches spread like the others that were carried off last year! Oh!\\r\\nwere I but already on the cart! Were I in the warm room with all the\\r\\nsplendor and magnificence! Yes; then something better, something still\\r\\ngrander, will surely follow, or wherefore should they thus ornament me?\\r\\nSomething better, something still grander must follow--but what? Oh, how\\r\\nI long, how I suffer! I do not know myself what is the matter with me!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rejoice in our presence!” said the Air and the Sunlight. “Rejoice in\\r\\nthy own fresh youth!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green\\r\\nboth winter and summer. People that saw him said, “What a fine tree!”\\r\\n and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe\\r\\nstruck deep into the very pith; the Tree fell to the earth with a sigh;\\r\\nhe felt a pang--it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness,\\r\\nfor he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place\\r\\nwhere he had sprung up. He well knew that he should never see his dear\\r\\nold comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, anymore; perhaps\\r\\nnot even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court-yard with\\r\\nthe other trees, and heard a man say, “That one is splendid! We don't\\r\\nwant the others.” Then two servants came in rich livery and carried the\\r\\nFir Tree into a large and splendid drawing-room. Portraits were hanging\\r\\non the walls, and near the white porcelain stove stood two large Chinese\\r\\nvases with lions on the covers. There, too, were large easy-chairs,\\r\\nsilken sofas, large tables full of picture-books and full of toys, worth\\r\\nhundreds and hundreds of crowns--at least the children said so. And the\\r\\nFir Tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand; but no\\r\\none could see that it was a cask, for green cloth was hung all round it,\\r\\nand it stood on a large gaily-colored carpet. Oh! how the Tree quivered!\\r\\nWhat was to happen? The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated\\r\\nit. On one branch there hung little nets cut out of colored paper, and\\r\\neach net was filled with sugarplums; and among the other boughs gilded\\r\\napples and walnuts were suspended, looking as though they had grown\\r\\nthere, and little blue and white tapers were placed among the leaves.\\r\\nDolls that looked for all the world like men--the Tree had never beheld\\r\\nsuch before--were seen among the foliage, and at the very top a\\r\\nlarge star of gold tinsel was fixed. It was really splendid--beyond\\r\\ndescription splendid.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This evening!” they all said. “How it will shine this evening!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” thought the Tree. “If the evening were but come! If the tapers\\r\\nwere but lighted! And then I wonder what will happen! Perhaps the other\\r\\ntrees from the forest will come to look at me! Perhaps the sparrows will\\r\\nbeat against the windowpanes! I wonder if I shall take root here, and\\r\\nwinter and summer stand covered with ornaments!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew very much about the matter--but he was so impatient that for\\r\\nsheer longing he got a pain in his back, and this with trees is the same\\r\\nthing as a headache with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe candles were now lighted--what brightness! What splendor! The\\r\\nTree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the\\r\\nfoliage. It blazed up famously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Help! Help!” cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Tree did not even dare tremble. What a state he was in! He was\\r\\nso uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor, that he was\\r\\nquite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness; when suddenly both\\r\\nfolding-doors opened and a troop of children rushed in as if they would\\r\\nupset the Tree. The older persons followed quietly; the little ones\\r\\nstood quite still. But it was only for a moment; then they shouted that\\r\\nthe whole place re-echoed with their rejoicing; they danced round the\\r\\nTree, and one present after the other was pulled off.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are they about?” thought the Tree. “What is to happen now!” And\\r\\nthe lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned down\\r\\nthey were put out one after the other, and then the children had\\r\\npermission to plunder the Tree. So they fell upon it with such violence\\r\\nthat all its branches cracked; if it had not been fixed firmly in the\\r\\nground, it would certainly have tumbled down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children danced about with their beautiful playthings; no one looked\\r\\nat the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between the branches; but\\r\\nit was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been\\r\\nforgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A story! A story!” cried the children, drawing a little fat man towards\\r\\nthe Tree. He seated himself under it and said, “Now we are in the shade,\\r\\nand the Tree can listen too. But I shall tell only one story. Now which\\r\\nwill you have; that about Ivedy-Avedy, or about Humpy-Dumpy, who\\r\\ntumbled downstairs, and yet after all came to the throne and married the\\r\\nprincess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ivedy-Avedy,” cried some; “Humpy-Dumpy,” cried the others. There was\\r\\nsuch a bawling and screaming--the Fir Tree alone was silent, and he\\r\\nthought to himself, “Am I not to bawl with the rest? Am I to do nothing\\r\\nwhatever?” for he was one of the company, and had done what he had to\\r\\ndo.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the man told about Humpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, who\\r\\nnotwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the princess.\\r\\nAnd the children clapped their hands, and cried. “Oh, go on! Do go on!”\\r\\n They wanted to hear about Ivedy-Avedy too, but the little man only told\\r\\nthem about Humpy-Dumpy. The Fir Tree stood quite still and absorbed\\r\\nin thought; the birds in the wood had never related the like of this.\\r\\n“Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess! Yes, yes!\\r\\nThat's the way of the world!” thought the Fir Tree, and believed it all,\\r\\nbecause the man who told the story was so good-looking. “Well, well! who\\r\\nknows, perhaps I may fall downstairs, too, and get a princess as wife!”\\r\\n And he looked forward with joy to the morrow, when he hoped to be decked\\r\\nout again with lights, playthings, fruits, and tinsel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won't tremble to-morrow!” thought the Fir Tree. “I will enjoy to\\r\\nthe full all my splendor! To-morrow I shall hear again the story of\\r\\nHumpy-Dumpy, and perhaps that of Ivedy-Avedy too.” And the whole night\\r\\nthe Tree stood still and in deep thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now then the splendor will begin again,” thought the Fir. But they\\r\\ndragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft: and here,\\r\\nin a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him. “What's\\r\\nthe meaning of this?” thought the Tree. “What am I to do here? What\\r\\nshall I hear now, I wonder?” And he leaned against the wall lost in\\r\\nreverie. Time enough had he too for his reflections; for days and nights\\r\\npassed on, and nobody came up; and when at last somebody did come, it\\r\\nwas only to put some great trunks in a corner, out of the way. There\\r\\nstood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirely\\r\\nforgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis now winter out-of-doors!” thought the Tree. “The earth is hard and\\r\\ncovered with snow; men cannot plant me now, and therefore I have been\\r\\nput up here under shelter till the spring-time comes! How thoughtful\\r\\nthat is! How kind man is, after all! If it only were not so dark here,\\r\\nand so terribly lonely! Not even a hare! And out in the woods it was\\r\\nso pleasant, when the snow was on the ground, and the hare leaped by;\\r\\nyes--even when he jumped over me; but I did not like it then! It is\\r\\nreally terribly lonely here!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Squeak! Squeak!” said a little Mouse, at the same moment, peeping out\\r\\nof his hole. And then another little one came. They snuffed about the\\r\\nFir Tree, and rustled among the branches.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is dreadfully cold,” said the Mouse. “But for that, it would be\\r\\ndelightful here, old Fir, wouldn't it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am by no means old,” said the Fir Tree. “There's many a one\\r\\nconsiderably older than I am.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where do you come from,” asked the Mice; “and what can you do?” They\\r\\nwere so extremely curious. “Tell us about the most beautiful spot on the\\r\\nearth. Have you never been there? Were you never in the larder, where\\r\\ncheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from above; where one dances\\r\\nabout on tallow candles: that place where one enters lean, and comes out\\r\\nagain fat and portly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know no such place,” said the Tree. “But I know the wood, where the\\r\\nsun shines and where the little birds sing.” And then he told all about\\r\\nhis youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before; and they\\r\\nlistened and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, to be sure! How much you have seen! How happy you must have\\r\\nbeen!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I!” said the Fir Tree, thinking over what he had himself related.\\r\\n“Yes, in reality those were happy times.” And then he told about\\r\\nChristmas-eve, when he was decked out with cakes and candles.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” said the little Mice, “how fortunate you have been, old Fir Tree!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am by no means old,” said he. “I came from the wood this winter; I am\\r\\nin my prime, and am only rather short for my age.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What delightful stories you know,” said the Mice: and the next night\\r\\nthey came with four other little Mice, who were to hear what the Tree\\r\\nrecounted: and the more he related, the more he remembered himself; and\\r\\nit appeared as if those times had really been happy times. “But they may\\r\\nstill come--they may still come! Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet\\r\\nhe got a princess!” and he thought at the moment of a nice little Birch\\r\\nTree growing out in the woods: to the Fir, that would be a real charming\\r\\nprincess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is Humpy-Dumpy?” asked the Mice. So then the Fir Tree told the\\r\\nwhole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; and the\\r\\nlittle Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree. Next night\\r\\ntwo more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats even; but they said the\\r\\nstories were not interesting, which vexed the little Mice; and they,\\r\\ntoo, now began to think them not so very amusing either.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know only one story?” asked the Rats.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only that one,” answered the Tree. “I heard it on my happiest evening;\\r\\nbut I did not then know how happy I was.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a very stupid story! Don't you know one about bacon and tallow\\r\\ncandles? Can't you tell any larder stories?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said the Tree.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then good-bye,” said the Rats; and they went home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: “After\\r\\nall, it was very pleasant when the sleek little Mice sat round me, and\\r\\nlistened to what I told them. Now that too is over. But I will take good\\r\\ncare to enjoy myself when I am brought out again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when was that to be? Why, one morning there came a quantity of\\r\\npeople and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved, the tree was\\r\\npulled out and thrown--rather hard, it is true--down on the floor, but a\\r\\nman drew him towards the stairs, where the daylight shone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now a merry life will begin again,” thought the Tree. He felt the fresh\\r\\nair, the first sunbeam--and now he was out in the courtyard. All passed\\r\\nso quickly, there was so much going on around him, the Tree quite forgot\\r\\nto look to himself. The court adjoined a garden, and all was in flower;\\r\\nthe roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade, the lindens\\r\\nwere in blossom, the Swallows flew by, and said, “Quirre-vit! My husband\\r\\nis come!” but it was not the Fir Tree that they meant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, then, I shall really enjoy life,” said he exultingly, and spread\\r\\nout his branches; but, alas, they were all withered and yellow! It was\\r\\nin a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles. The golden star of\\r\\ntinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in the sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the court-yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced\\r\\nat Christmas round the Fir Tree, and were so glad at the sight of him.\\r\\nOne of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only look what is still on the ugly old Christmas tree!” said he,\\r\\ntrampling on the branches, so that they all cracked beneath his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness in\\r\\nthe garden; he beheld himself, and wished he had remained in his dark\\r\\ncorner in the loft; he thought of his first youth in the wood, of the\\r\\nmerry Christmas-eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with so\\r\\nmuch pleasure to the story of Humpy-Dumpy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis over--'tis past!” said the poor Tree. “Had I but rejoiced when I\\r\\nhad reason to do so! But now 'tis past, 'tis past!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was a\\r\\nwhole heap lying there. The wood flamed up splendidly under the large\\r\\nbrewing copper, and it sighed so deeply! Each sigh was like a shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold star\\r\\non his breast which the Tree had had on the happiest evening of his\\r\\nlife. However, that was over now--the Tree gone, the story at an end.\\r\\nAll, all was over--every tale must end at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SNOW QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST STORY. Which Treats of a Mirror and of the Splinters\\r\\n\\r\\nNow then, let us begin. When we are at the end of the story, we shall\\r\\nknow more than we know now: but to begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a wicked sprite, indeed he was the most\\r\\nmischievous of all sprites. One day he was in a very good humor, for\\r\\nhe had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and\\r\\nbeautiful when it was reflected therein, to look poor and mean; but\\r\\nthat which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified\\r\\nand increased in ugliness. In this mirror the most beautiful landscapes\\r\\nlooked like boiled spinach, and the best persons were turned into\\r\\nfrights, or appeared to stand on their heads; their faces were so\\r\\ndistorted that they were not to be recognised; and if anyone had a mole,\\r\\nyou might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose\\r\\nand mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That's glorious fun!” said the sprite. If a good thought passed through\\r\\na man's mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and the sprite laughed\\r\\nheartily at his clever discovery. All the little sprites who went to his\\r\\nschool--for he kept a sprite school--told each other that a miracle had\\r\\nhappened; and that now only, as they thought, it would be possible to\\r\\nsee how the world really looked. They ran about with the mirror; and at\\r\\nlast there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted\\r\\nin the mirror. So then they thought they would fly up to the sky,\\r\\nand have a joke there. The higher they flew with the mirror, the more\\r\\nterribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast. Higher and higher\\r\\nstill they flew, nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly the\\r\\nmirror shook so terribly with grinning, that it flew out of their hands\\r\\nand fell to the earth, where it was dashed in a hundred million and more\\r\\npieces. And now it worked much more evil than before; for some of these\\r\\npieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they flew about in\\r\\nthe wide world, and when they got into people's eyes, there they stayed;\\r\\nand then people saw everything perverted, or only had an eye for that\\r\\nwhich was evil. This happened because the very smallest bit had the\\r\\nsame power which the whole mirror had possessed. Some persons even got\\r\\na splinter in their heart, and then it made one shudder, for their heart\\r\\nbecame like a lump of ice. Some of the broken pieces were so large that\\r\\nthey were used for windowpanes, through which one could not see one's\\r\\nfriends. Other pieces were put in spectacles; and that was a sad affair\\r\\nwhen people put on their glasses to see well and rightly. Then the\\r\\nwicked sprite laughed till he almost choked, for all this tickled his\\r\\nfancy. The fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall\\r\\nhear what happened next.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND STORY. A Little Boy and a Little Girl\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a large town, where there are so many houses, and so many people,\\r\\nthat there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden; and\\r\\nwhere, on this account, most persons are obliged to content themselves\\r\\nwith flowers in pots; there lived two little children, who had a garden\\r\\nsomewhat larger than a flower-pot. They were not brother and sister; but\\r\\nthey cared for each other as much as if they were. Their parents lived\\r\\nexactly opposite. They inhabited two garrets; and where the roof of the\\r\\none house joined that of the other, and the gutter ran along the extreme\\r\\nend of it, there was to each house a small window: one needed only to\\r\\nstep over the gutter to get from one window to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children's parents had large wooden boxes there, in which vegetables\\r\\nfor the kitchen were planted, and little rosetrees besides: there was a\\r\\nrose in each box, and they grew splendidly. They now thought of placing\\r\\nthe boxes across the gutter, so that they nearly reached from one window\\r\\nto the other, and looked just like two walls of flowers. The tendrils\\r\\nof the peas hung down over the boxes; and the rose-trees shot up long\\r\\nbranches, twined round the windows, and then bent towards each other: it\\r\\nwas almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers. The boxes were\\r\\nvery high, and the children knew that they must not creep over them; so\\r\\nthey often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other,\\r\\nand to sit on their little stools among the roses, where they could play\\r\\ndelightfully. In winter there was an end of this pleasure. The windows\\r\\nwere often frozen over; but then they heated copper farthings on the\\r\\nstove, and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane, and then they had a\\r\\ncapital peep-hole, quite nicely rounded; and out of each peeped a gentle\\r\\nfriendly eye--it was the little boy and the little girl who were looking\\r\\nout. His name was Kay, hers was Gerda. In summer, with one jump, they\\r\\ncould get to each other; but in winter they were obliged first to\\r\\ngo down the long stairs, and then up the long stairs again: and\\r\\nout-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is the white bees that are swarming,” said Kay's old grandmother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do the white bees choose a queen?” asked the little boy; for he knew\\r\\nthat the honey-bees always have one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said the grandmother, “she flies where the swarm hangs in the\\r\\nthickest clusters. She is the largest of all; and she can never remain\\r\\nquietly on the earth, but goes up again into the black clouds. Many a\\r\\nwinter's night she flies through the streets of the town, and peeps in\\r\\nat the windows; and they then freeze in so wondrous a manner that they\\r\\nlook like flowers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have seen it,” said both the children; and so they knew that it\\r\\nwas true.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can the Snow Queen come in?” said the little girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only let her come in!” said the little boy. “Then I'd put her on the\\r\\nstove, and she'd melt.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then his grandmother patted his head and told him other stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, when little Kay was at home, and half undressed, he\\r\\nclimbed up on the chair by the window, and peeped out of the little\\r\\nhole. A few snow-flakes were falling, and one, the largest of all,\\r\\nremained lying on the edge of a flower-pot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flake of snow grew larger and larger; and at last it was like a\\r\\nyoung lady, dressed in the finest white gauze, made of a million little\\r\\nflakes like stars. She was so beautiful and delicate, but she was of\\r\\nice, of dazzling, sparkling ice; yet she lived; her eyes gazed fixedly,\\r\\nlike two stars; but there was neither quiet nor repose in them. She\\r\\nnodded towards the window, and beckoned with her hand. The little boy\\r\\nwas frightened, and jumped down from the chair; it seemed to him as if,\\r\\nat the same moment, a large bird flew past the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day it was a sharp frost--and then the spring came; the sun\\r\\nshone, the green leaves appeared, the swallows built their nests, the\\r\\nwindows were opened, and the little children again sat in their pretty\\r\\ngarden, high up on the leads at the top of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty. The little girl had\\r\\nlearned a hymn, in which there was something about roses; and then she\\r\\nthought of her own flowers; and she sang the verse to the little boy,\\r\\nwho then sang it with her:\\r\\n\\r\\n     “The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,\\r\\n     And angels descend there the children to greet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the children held each other by the hand, kissed the roses, looked\\r\\nup at the clear sunshine, and spoke as though they really saw angels\\r\\nthere. What lovely summer-days those were! How delightful to be out in\\r\\nthe air, near the fresh rose-bushes, that seem as if they would never\\r\\nfinish blossoming!\\r\\n\\r\\nKay and Gerda looked at the picture-book full of beasts and of birds;\\r\\nand it was then--the clock in the church-tower was just striking\\r\\nfive--that Kay said, “Oh! I feel such a sharp pain in my heart; and now\\r\\nsomething has got into my eye!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl put her arms around his neck. He winked his eyes; now\\r\\nthere was nothing to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it is out now,” said he; but it was not. It was just one of\\r\\nthose pieces of glass from the magic mirror that had got into his eye;\\r\\nand poor Kay had got another piece right in his heart. It will soon\\r\\nbecome like ice. It did not hurt any longer, but there it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you crying for?” asked he. “You look so ugly! There's nothing\\r\\nthe matter with me. Ah,” said he at once, “that rose is cankered! And\\r\\nlook, this one is quite crooked! After all, these roses are very ugly!\\r\\nThey are just like the box they are planted in!” And then he gave the\\r\\nbox a good kick with his foot, and pulled both the roses up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing?” cried the little girl; and as he perceived her\\r\\nfright, he pulled up another rose, got in at the window, and hastened\\r\\noff from dear little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards, when she brought her picture-book, he asked, “What horrid\\r\\nbeasts have you there?” And if his grandmother told them stories, he\\r\\nalways interrupted her; besides, if he could manage it, he would get\\r\\nbehind her, put on her spectacles, and imitate her way of speaking; he\\r\\ncopied all her ways, and then everybody laughed at him. He was soon able\\r\\nto imitate the gait and manner of everyone in the street. Everything\\r\\nthat was peculiar and displeasing in them--that Kay knew how to imitate:\\r\\nand at such times all the people said, “The boy is certainly very\\r\\nclever!” But it was the glass he had got in his eye; the glass that was\\r\\nsticking in his heart, which made him tease even little Gerda, whose\\r\\nwhole soul was devoted to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis games now were quite different to what they had formerly been, they\\r\\nwere so very knowing. One winter's day, when the flakes of snow were\\r\\nflying about, he spread the skirts of his blue coat, and caught the snow\\r\\nas it fell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look through this glass, Gerda,” said he. And every flake seemed\\r\\nlarger, and appeared like a magnificent flower, or beautiful star; it\\r\\nwas splendid to look at!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look, how clever!” said Kay. “That's much more interesting than real\\r\\nflowers! They are as exact as possible; there is not a fault in them, if\\r\\nthey did not melt!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long after this, that Kay came one day with large gloves on,\\r\\nand his little sledge at his back, and bawled right into Gerda's ears,\\r\\n“I have permission to go out into the square where the others are\\r\\nplaying”; and off he was in a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, in the market-place, some of the boldest of the boys used to tie\\r\\ntheir sledges to the carts as they passed by, and so they were pulled\\r\\nalong, and got a good ride. It was so capital! Just as they were in the\\r\\nvery height of their amusement, a large sledge passed by: it was painted\\r\\nquite white, and there was someone in it wrapped up in a rough white\\r\\nmantle of fur, with a rough white fur cap on his head. The sledge drove\\r\\nround the square twice, and Kay tied on his sledge as quickly as he\\r\\ncould, and off he drove with it. On they went quicker and quicker into\\r\\nthe next street; and the person who drove turned round to Kay, and\\r\\nnodded to him in a friendly manner, just as if they knew each other.\\r\\nEvery time he was going to untie his sledge, the person nodded to him,\\r\\nand then Kay sat quiet; and so on they went till they came outside\\r\\nthe gates of the town. Then the snow began to fall so thickly that the\\r\\nlittle boy could not see an arm's length before him, but still on he\\r\\nwent: when suddenly he let go the string he held in his hand in order\\r\\nto get loose from the sledge, but it was of no use; still the little\\r\\nvehicle rushed on with the quickness of the wind. He then cried as loud\\r\\nas he could, but no one heard him; the snow drifted and the sledge flew\\r\\non, and sometimes it gave a jerk as though they were driving over hedges\\r\\nand ditches. He was quite frightened, and he tried to repeat the\\r\\nLord's Prayer; but all he could do, he was only able to remember the\\r\\nmultiplication table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow-flakes grew larger and larger, till at last they looked just\\r\\nlike great white fowls. Suddenly they flew on one side; the large sledge\\r\\nstopped, and the person who drove rose up. It was a lady; her cloak and\\r\\ncap were of snow. She was tall and of slender figure, and of a dazzling\\r\\nwhiteness. It was the Snow Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have travelled fast,” said she; “but it is freezingly cold. Come\\r\\nunder my bearskin.” And she put him in the sledge beside her,\\r\\nwrapped the fur round him, and he felt as though he were sinking in a\\r\\nsnow-wreath.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you still cold?” asked she; and then she kissed his forehead.\\r\\nAh! it was colder than ice; it penetrated to his very heart, which was\\r\\nalready almost a frozen lump; it seemed to him as if he were about to\\r\\ndie--but a moment more and it was quite congenial to him, and he did not\\r\\nremark the cold that was around him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My sledge! Do not forget my sledge!” It was the first thing he thought\\r\\nof. It was there tied to one of the white chickens, who flew along with\\r\\nit on his back behind the large sledge. The Snow Queen kissed Kay once\\r\\nmore, and then he forgot little Gerda, grandmother, and all whom he had\\r\\nleft at his home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now you will have no more kisses,” said she, “or else I should kiss you\\r\\nto death!”\\r\\n\\r\\nKay looked at her. She was very beautiful; a more clever, or a more\\r\\nlovely countenance he could not fancy to himself; and she no longer\\r\\nappeared of ice as before, when she sat outside the window, and beckoned\\r\\nto him; in his eyes she was perfect, he did not fear her at all, and\\r\\ntold her that he could calculate in his head and with fractions, even;\\r\\nthat he knew the number of square miles there were in the different\\r\\ncountries, and how many inhabitants they contained; and she smiled while\\r\\nhe spoke. It then seemed to him as if what he knew was not enough, and\\r\\nhe looked upwards in the large huge empty space above him, and on she\\r\\nflew with him; flew high over the black clouds, while the storm moaned\\r\\nand whistled as though it were singing some old tune. On they flew\\r\\nover woods and lakes, over seas, and many lands; and beneath them the\\r\\nchilling storm rushed fast, the wolves howled, the snow crackled; above\\r\\nthem flew large screaming crows, but higher up appeared the moon, quite\\r\\nlarge and bright; and it was on it that Kay gazed during the long long\\r\\nwinter's night; while by day he slept at the feet of the Snow Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD STORY. Of the Flower-Garden At the Old Woman's Who Understood\\r\\nWitchcraft\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what became of little Gerda when Kay did not return? Where could he\\r\\nbe? Nobody knew; nobody could give any intelligence. All the boys knew\\r\\nwas, that they had seen him tie his sledge to another large and splendid\\r\\none, which drove down the street and out of the town. Nobody knew\\r\\nwhere he was; many sad tears were shed, and little Gerda wept long and\\r\\nbitterly; at last she said he must be dead; that he had been drowned in\\r\\nthe river which flowed close to the town. Oh! those were very long and\\r\\ndismal winter evenings!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last spring came, with its warm sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kay is dead and gone!” said little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I don't believe,” said the Sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kay is dead and gone!” said she to the Swallows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I don't believe,” said they: and at last little Gerda did not\\r\\nthink so any longer either.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I'll put on my red shoes,” said she, one morning; “Kay has never seen\\r\\nthem, and then I'll go down to the river and ask there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite early; she kissed her old grandmother, who was still\\r\\nasleep, put on her red shoes, and went alone to the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will make you a\\r\\npresent of my red shoes, if you will give him back to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as it seemed to her, the blue waves nodded in a strange manner;\\r\\nthen she took off her red shoes, the most precious things she possessed,\\r\\nand threw them both into the river. But they fell close to the bank, and\\r\\nthe little waves bore them immediately to land; it was as if the stream\\r\\nwould not take what was dearest to her; for in reality it had not got\\r\\nlittle Kay; but Gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far\\r\\nenough, so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes, went\\r\\nto the farthest end, and threw out the shoes. But the boat was not\\r\\nfastened, and the motion which she occasioned, made it drift from the\\r\\nshore. She observed this, and hastened to get back; but before she could\\r\\ndo so, the boat was more than a yard from the land, and was gliding\\r\\nquickly onward.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Gerda was very frightened, and began to cry; but no one heard her\\r\\nexcept the sparrows, and they could not carry her to land; but they flew\\r\\nalong the bank, and sang as if to comfort her, “Here we are! Here we\\r\\nare!” The boat drifted with the stream, little Gerda sat quite still\\r\\nwithout shoes, for they were swimming behind the boat, but she could not\\r\\nreach them, because the boat went much faster than they did.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banks on both sides were beautiful; lovely flowers, venerable trees,\\r\\nand slopes with sheep and cows, but not a human being was to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay,” said she; and then\\r\\nshe grew less sad. She rose, and looked for many hours at the beautiful\\r\\ngreen banks. Presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard, where was\\r\\na little cottage with curious red and blue windows; it was thatched,\\r\\nand before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry, and presented arms when\\r\\nanyone went past.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerda called to them, for she thought they were alive; but they, of\\r\\ncourse, did not answer. She came close to them, for the stream drifted\\r\\nthe boat quite near the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerda called still louder, and an old woman then came out of the\\r\\ncottage, leaning upon a crooked stick. She had a large broad-brimmed hat\\r\\non, painted with the most splendid flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor little child!” said the old woman. “How did you get upon the large\\r\\nrapid river, to be driven about so in the wide world!” And then the\\r\\nold woman went into the water, caught hold of the boat with her crooked\\r\\nstick, drew it to the bank, and lifted little Gerda out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda was so glad to be on dry land again; but she was rather afraid\\r\\nof the strange old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But come and tell me who you are, and how you came here,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda told her all; and the old woman shook her head and said,\\r\\n“A-hem! a-hem!” and when Gerda had told her everything, and asked her if\\r\\nshe had not seen little Kay, the woman answered that he had not passed\\r\\nthere, but he no doubt would come; and she told her not to be cast down,\\r\\nbut taste her cherries, and look at her flowers, which were finer than\\r\\nany in a picture-book, each of which could tell a whole story. She then\\r\\ntook Gerda by the hand, led her into the little cottage, and locked the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe windows were very high up; the glass was red, blue, and green, and\\r\\nthe sunlight shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of colors. On\\r\\nthe table stood the most exquisite cherries, and Gerda ate as many as\\r\\nshe chose, for she had permission to do so. While she was eating, the\\r\\nold woman combed her hair with a golden comb, and her hair curled and\\r\\nshone with a lovely golden color around that sweet little face, which\\r\\nwas so round and so like a rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have often longed for such a dear little girl,” said the old woman.\\r\\n“Now you shall see how well we agree together”; and while she combed\\r\\nlittle Gerda's hair, the child forgot her foster-brother Kay more and\\r\\nmore, for the old woman understood magic; but she was no evil being, she\\r\\nonly practised witchcraft a little for her own private amusement, and\\r\\nnow she wanted very much to keep little Gerda. She therefore went out\\r\\nin the garden, stretched out her crooked stick towards the rose-bushes,\\r\\nwhich, beautifully as they were blowing, all sank into the earth and no\\r\\none could tell where they had stood. The old woman feared that if Gerda\\r\\nshould see the roses, she would then think of her own, would remember\\r\\nlittle Kay, and run away from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe now led Gerda into the flower-garden. Oh, what odour and what\\r\\nloveliness was there! Every flower that one could think of, and of every\\r\\nseason, stood there in fullest bloom; no picture-book could be gayer or\\r\\nmore beautiful. Gerda jumped for joy, and played till the sun set behind\\r\\nthe tall cherry-tree; she then had a pretty bed, with a red silken\\r\\ncoverlet filled with blue violets. She fell asleep, and had as pleasant\\r\\ndreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine,\\r\\nand thus passed away a day. Gerda knew every flower; and, numerous as\\r\\nthey were, it still seemed to Gerda that one was wanting, though she\\r\\ndid not know which. One day while she was looking at the hat of the old\\r\\nwoman painted with flowers, the most beautiful of them all seemed to her\\r\\nto be a rose. The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat\\r\\nwhen she made the others vanish in the earth. But so it is when one's\\r\\nthoughts are not collected. “What!” said Gerda. “Are there no roses\\r\\nhere?” and she ran about amongst the flowerbeds, and looked, and looked,\\r\\nbut there was not one to be found. She then sat down and wept; but her\\r\\nhot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk; and when her warm tears\\r\\nwatered the ground, the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as\\r\\nwhen it had been swallowed up. Gerda kissed the roses, thought of her\\r\\nown dear roses at home, and with them of little Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, how long I have stayed!” said the little girl. “I intended to look\\r\\nfor Kay! Don't you know where he is?” she asked of the roses. “Do you\\r\\nthink he is dead and gone?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dead he certainly is not,” said the Roses. “We have been in the earth\\r\\nwhere all the dead are, but Kay was not there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Many thanks!” said little Gerda; and she went to the other flowers,\\r\\nlooked into their cups, and asked, “Don't you know where little Kay is?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut every flower stood in the sunshine, and dreamed its own fairy tale\\r\\nor its own story: and they all told her very many things, but not one\\r\\nknew anything of Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, what did the Tiger-Lily say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hearest thou not the drum? Bum! Bum! Those are the only two tones.\\r\\nAlways bum! Bum! Hark to the plaintive song of the old woman, to the\\r\\ncall of the priests! The Hindoo woman in her long robe stands upon the\\r\\nfuneral pile; the flames rise around her and her dead husband, but the\\r\\nHindoo woman thinks on the living one in the surrounding circle; on him\\r\\nwhose eyes burn hotter than the flames--on him, the fire of whose eyes\\r\\npierces her heart more than the flames which soon will burn her body to\\r\\nashes. Can the heart's flame die in the flame of the funeral pile?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don't understand that at all,” said little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is my story,” said the Lily.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did the Convolvulus say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Projecting over a narrow mountain-path there hangs an old feudal\\r\\ncastle. Thick evergreens grow on the dilapidated walls, and around the\\r\\naltar, where a lovely maiden is standing: she bends over the railing and\\r\\nlooks out upon the rose. No fresher rose hangs on the branches than she;\\r\\nno appleblossom carried away by the wind is more buoyant! How her silken\\r\\nrobe is rustling!\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Is he not yet come?'”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it Kay that you mean?” asked little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am speaking about my story--about my dream,” answered the\\r\\nConvolvulus.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did the Snowdrops say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Between the trees a long board is hanging--it is a swing. Two little\\r\\ngirls are sitting in it, and swing themselves backwards and forwards;\\r\\ntheir frocks are as white as snow, and long green silk ribands flutter\\r\\nfrom their bonnets. Their brother, who is older than they are, stands up\\r\\nin the swing; he twines his arms round the cords to hold himself fast,\\r\\nfor in one hand he has a little cup, and in the other a clay-pipe. He is\\r\\nblowing soap-bubbles. The swing moves, and the bubbles float in charming\\r\\nchanging colors: the last is still hanging to the end of the pipe, and\\r\\nrocks in the breeze. The swing moves. The little black dog, as light as\\r\\na soap-bubble, jumps up on his hind legs to try to get into the swing.\\r\\nIt moves, the dog falls down, barks, and is angry. They tease him; the\\r\\nbubble bursts! A swing, a bursting bubble--such is my song!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What you relate may be very pretty, but you tell it in so melancholy a\\r\\nmanner, and do not mention Kay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do the Hyacinths say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“There were once upon a time three sisters, quite transparent, and very\\r\\nbeautiful. The robe of the one was red, that of the second blue, and\\r\\nthat of the third white. They danced hand in hand beside the calm\\r\\nlake in the clear moonshine. They were not elfin maidens, but mortal\\r\\nchildren. A sweet fragrance was smelt, and the maidens vanished in the\\r\\nwood; the fragrance grew stronger--three coffins, and in them three\\r\\nlovely maidens, glided out of the forest and across the lake: the\\r\\nshining glow-worms flew around like little floating lights. Do the\\r\\ndancing maidens sleep, or are they dead? The odour of the flowers says\\r\\nthey are corpses; the evening bell tolls for the dead!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You make me quite sad,” said little Gerda. “I cannot help thinking of\\r\\nthe dead maidens. Oh! is little Kay really dead? The Roses have been in\\r\\nthe earth, and they say no.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ding, dong!” sounded the Hyacinth bells. “We do not toll for little\\r\\nKay; we do not know him. That is our way of singing, the only one we\\r\\nhave.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda went to the Ranunculuses, that looked forth from among the\\r\\nshining green leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a little bright sun!” said Gerda. “Tell me if you know where I\\r\\ncan find my playfellow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Ranunculus shone brightly, and looked again at Gerda. What\\r\\nsong could the Ranunculus sing? It was one that said nothing about Kay\\r\\neither.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In a small court the bright sun was shining in the first days of\\r\\nspring. The beams glided down the white walls of a neighbor's house, and\\r\\nclose by the fresh yellow flowers were growing, shining like gold in\\r\\nthe warm sun-rays. An old grandmother was sitting in the air; her\\r\\ngrand-daughter, the poor and lovely servant just come for a short visit.\\r\\nShe knows her grandmother. There was gold, pure virgin gold in that\\r\\nblessed kiss. There, that is my little story,” said the Ranunculus.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My poor old grandmother!” sighed Gerda. “Yes, she is longing for me,\\r\\nno doubt: she is sorrowing for me, as she did for little Kay. But I\\r\\nwill soon come home, and then I will bring Kay with me. It is of no use\\r\\nasking the flowers; they only know their own old rhymes, and can tell me\\r\\nnothing.” And she tucked up her frock, to enable her to run quicker; but\\r\\nthe Narcissus gave her a knock on the leg, just as she was going to\\r\\njump over it. So she stood still, looked at the long yellow flower, and\\r\\nasked, “You perhaps know something?” and she bent down to the Narcissus.\\r\\nAnd what did it say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can see myself--I can see myself! Oh, how odorous I am! Up in the\\r\\nlittle garret there stands, half-dressed, a little Dancer. She stands\\r\\nnow on one leg, now on both; she despises the whole world; yet she lives\\r\\nonly in imagination. She pours water out of the teapot over a piece of\\r\\nstuff which she holds in her hand; it is the bodice; cleanliness is a\\r\\nfine thing. The white dress is hanging on the hook; it was washed in the\\r\\nteapot, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, ties a saffron-colored\\r\\nkerchief round her neck, and then the gown looks whiter. I can see\\r\\nmyself--I can see myself!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That's nothing to me,” said little Gerda. “That does not concern me.”\\r\\n And then off she ran to the further end of the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gate was locked, but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened,\\r\\nand the gate opened; and little Gerda ran off barefooted into the wide\\r\\nworld. She looked round her thrice, but no one followed her. At last she\\r\\ncould run no longer; she sat down on a large stone, and when she looked\\r\\nabout her, she saw that the summer had passed; it was late in the\\r\\nautumn, but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden, where\\r\\nthere was always sunshine, and where there were flowers the whole year\\r\\nround.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me, how long I have staid!” said Gerda. “Autumn is come. I must\\r\\nnot rest any longer.” And she got up to go further.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, how tender and wearied her little feet were! All around it looked\\r\\nso cold and raw: the long willow-leaves were quite yellow, and the fog\\r\\ndripped from them like water; one leaf fell after the other: the sloes\\r\\nonly stood full of fruit, which set one's teeth on edge. Oh, how dark\\r\\nand comfortless it was in the dreary world!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOURTH STORY. The Prince and Princess\\r\\n\\r\\nGerda was obliged to rest herself again, when, exactly opposite to her,\\r\\na large Raven came hopping over the white snow. He had long been looking\\r\\nat Gerda and shaking his head; and now he said, “Caw! Caw!” Good day!\\r\\nGood day! He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the\\r\\nlittle girl, and asked her where she was going all alone. The word\\r\\n“alone” Gerda understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed\\r\\nby it; so she told the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not\\r\\nseen Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Raven nodded very gravely, and said, “It may be--it may be!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, do you really think so?” cried the little girl; and she nearly\\r\\nsqueezed the Raven to death, so much did she kiss him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gently, gently,” said the Raven. “I think I know; I think that it may\\r\\nbe little Kay. But now he has forgotten you for the Princess.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does he live with a Princess?” asked Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes--listen,” said the Raven; “but it will be difficult for me to\\r\\nspeak your language. If you understand the Raven language I can tell you\\r\\nbetter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I have not learnt it,” said Gerda; “but my grandmother understands\\r\\nit, and she can speak gibberish too. I wish I had learnt it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No matter,” said the Raven; “I will tell you as well as I can; however,\\r\\nit will be bad enough.” And then he told all he knew.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the kingdom where we now are there lives a Princess, who is\\r\\nextraordinarily clever; for she has read all the newspapers in the whole\\r\\nworld, and has forgotten them again--so clever is she. She was lately,\\r\\nit is said, sitting on her throne--which is not very amusing after\\r\\nall--when she began humming an old tune, and it was just, 'Oh, why\\r\\nshould I not be married?' 'That song is not without its meaning,' said\\r\\nshe, and so then she was determined to marry; but she would have a\\r\\nhusband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to--not\\r\\none who looked only as if he were a great personage, for that is so\\r\\ntiresome. She then had all the ladies of the court drummed together; and\\r\\nwhen they heard her intention, all were very pleased, and said, 'We are\\r\\nvery glad to hear it; it is the very thing we were thinking of.' You may\\r\\nbelieve every word I say,” said the Raven; “for I have a tame sweetheart\\r\\nthat hops about in the palace quite free, and it was she who told me all\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The newspapers appeared forthwith with a border of hearts and the\\r\\ninitials of the Princess; and therein you might read that every\\r\\ngood-looking young man was at liberty to come to the palace and speak to\\r\\nthe Princess; and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt himself at\\r\\nhome there, that one the Princess would choose for her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Yes,” said the Raven, “you may believe it; it is as true as I am\\r\\nsitting here. People came in crowds; there was a crush and a hurry, but\\r\\nno one was successful either on the first or second day. They could all\\r\\ntalk well enough when they were out in the street; but as soon as\\r\\nthey came inside the palace gates, and saw the guard richly dressed\\r\\nin silver, and the lackeys in gold on the staircase, and the large\\r\\nilluminated saloons, then they were abashed; and when they stood before\\r\\nthe throne on which the Princess was sitting, all they could do was\\r\\nto repeat the last word they had uttered, and to hear it again did not\\r\\ninterest her very much. It was just as if the people within were under\\r\\na charm, and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the\\r\\nstreet; for then--oh, then--they could chatter enough. There was a whole\\r\\nrow of them standing from the town-gates to the palace. I was there\\r\\nmyself to look,” said the Raven. “They grew hungry and thirsty; but from\\r\\nthe palace they got nothing whatever, not even a glass of water. Some\\r\\nof the cleverest, it is true, had taken bread and butter with them:\\r\\nbut none shared it with his neighbor, for each thought, 'Let him look\\r\\nhungry, and then the Princess won't have him.'”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But Kay--little Kay,” said Gerda, “when did he come? Was he among the\\r\\nnumber?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Patience, patience; we are just come to him. It was on the third day\\r\\nwhen a little personage without horse or equipage, came marching right\\r\\nboldly up to the palace; his eyes shone like yours, he had beautiful\\r\\nlong hair, but his clothes were very shabby.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was Kay,” cried Gerda, with a voice of delight. “Oh, now I've\\r\\nfound him!” and she clapped her hands for joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He had a little knapsack at his back,” said the Raven.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, that was certainly his sledge,” said Gerda; “for when he went away\\r\\nhe took his sledge with him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That may be,” said the Raven; “I did not examine him so minutely; but\\r\\nI know from my tame sweetheart, that when he came into the court-yard\\r\\nof the palace, and saw the body-guard in silver, the lackeys on the\\r\\nstaircase, he was not the least abashed; he nodded, and said to them,\\r\\n'It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs; for my part, I shall\\r\\ngo in.' The saloons were gleaming with lustres--privy councillors and\\r\\nexcellencies were walking about barefooted, and wore gold keys; it was\\r\\nenough to make any one feel uncomfortable. His boots creaked, too, so\\r\\nloudly, but still he was not at all afraid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That's Kay for certain,” said Gerda. “I know he had on new boots; I\\r\\nhave heard them creaking in grandmama's room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they creaked,” said the Raven. “And on he went boldly up to the\\r\\nPrincess, who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel.\\r\\nAll the ladies of the court, with their attendants and attendants'\\r\\nattendants, and all the cavaliers, with their gentlemen and gentlemen's\\r\\ngentlemen, stood round; and the nearer they stood to the door, the\\r\\nprouder they looked. It was hardly possible to look at the gentleman's\\r\\ngentleman, so very haughtily did he stand in the doorway.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must have been terrible,” said little Gerda. “And did Kay get the\\r\\nPrincess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Were I not a Raven, I should have taken the Princess myself, although\\r\\nI am promised. It is said he spoke as well as I speak when I talk Raven\\r\\nlanguage; this I learned from my tame sweetheart. He was bold and nicely\\r\\nbehaved; he had not come to woo the Princess, but only to hear her\\r\\nwisdom. She pleased him, and he pleased her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes; for certain that was Kay,” said Gerda. “He was so clever;\\r\\nhe could reckon fractions in his head. Oh, won't you take me to the\\r\\npalace?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is very easily said,” answered the Raven. “But how are we to\\r\\nmanage it? I'll speak to my tame sweetheart about it: she must advise\\r\\nus; for so much I must tell you, such a little girl as you are will\\r\\nnever get permission to enter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes I shall,” said Gerda; “when Kay hears that I am here, he will\\r\\ncome out directly to fetch me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait for me here on these steps,” said the Raven. He moved his head\\r\\nbackwards and forwards and flew away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was closing in when the Raven returned. “Caw--caw!” said he.\\r\\n“She sends you her compliments; and here is a roll for you. She took\\r\\nit out of the kitchen, where there is bread enough. You are hungry,\\r\\nno doubt. It is not possible for you to enter the palace, for you are\\r\\nbarefooted: the guards in silver, and the lackeys in gold, would not\\r\\nallow it; but do not cry, you shall come in still. My sweetheart knows a\\r\\nlittle back stair that leads to the bedchamber, and she knows where she\\r\\ncan get the key of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they went into the garden in the large avenue, where one leaf was\\r\\nfalling after the other; and when the lights in the palace had all\\r\\ngradually disappeared, the Raven led little Gerda to the back door,\\r\\nwhich stood half open.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, how Gerda's heart beat with anxiety and longing! It was just as if\\r\\nshe had been about to do something wrong; and yet she only wanted to\\r\\nknow if little Kay was there. Yes, he must be there. She called to mind\\r\\nhis intelligent eyes, and his long hair, so vividly, she could quite see\\r\\nhim as he used to laugh when they were sitting under the roses at home.\\r\\n“He will, no doubt, be glad to see you--to hear what a long way you have\\r\\ncome for his sake; to know how unhappy all at home were when he did not\\r\\ncome back.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, what a fright and a joy it was!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now on the stairs. A single lamp was burning there; and on the\\r\\nfloor stood the tame Raven, turning her head on every side and looking\\r\\nat Gerda, who bowed as her grandmother had taught her to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My intended has told me so much good of you, my dear young lady,” said\\r\\nthe tame Raven. “Your tale is very affecting. If you will take the lamp,\\r\\nI will go before. We will go straight on, for we shall meet no one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think there is somebody just behind us,” said Gerda; and something\\r\\nrushed past: it was like shadowy figures on the wall; horses with\\r\\nflowing manes and thin legs, huntsmen, ladies and gentlemen on\\r\\nhorseback.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are only dreams,” said the Raven. “They come to fetch the thoughts\\r\\nof the high personages to the chase; 'tis well, for now you can observe\\r\\nthem in bed all the better. But let me find, when you enjoy honor and\\r\\ndistinction, that you possess a grateful heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tut! That's not worth talking about,” said the Raven of the woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now entered the first saloon, which was of rose-colored satin, with\\r\\nartificial flowers on the wall. Here the dreams were rushing past,\\r\\nbut they hastened by so quickly that Gerda could not see the high\\r\\npersonages. One hall was more magnificent than the other; one might\\r\\nindeed well be abashed; and at last they came into the bedchamber. The\\r\\nceiling of the room resembled a large palm-tree with leaves of glass,\\r\\nof costly glass; and in the middle, from a thick golden stem, hung two\\r\\nbeds, each of which resembled a lily. One was white, and in this lay the\\r\\nPrincess; the other was red, and it was here that Gerda was to look for\\r\\nlittle Kay. She bent back one of the red leaves, and saw a brown neck.\\r\\nOh! that was Kay! She called him quite loud by name, held the lamp\\r\\ntowards him--the dreams rushed back again into the chamber--he awoke,\\r\\nturned his head, and--it was not little Kay!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prince was only like him about the neck; but he was young and\\r\\nhandsome. And out of the white lily leaves the Princess peeped, too,\\r\\nand asked what was the matter. Then little Gerda cried, and told her her\\r\\nwhole history, and all that the Ravens had done for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor little thing!” said the Prince and the Princess. They praised the\\r\\nRavens very much, and told them they were not at all angry with them,\\r\\nbut they were not to do so again. However, they should have a reward.\\r\\n“Will you fly about here at liberty,” asked the Princess; “or would you\\r\\nlike to have a fixed appointment as court ravens, with all the broken\\r\\nbits from the kitchen?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd both the Ravens nodded, and begged for a fixed appointment; for\\r\\nthey thought of their old age, and said, “It is a good thing to have a\\r\\nprovision for our old days.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Prince got up and let Gerda sleep in his bed, and more than this\\r\\nhe could not do. She folded her little hands and thought, “How good men\\r\\nand animals are!” and she then fell asleep and slept soundly. All the\\r\\ndreams flew in again, and they now looked like the angels; they drew\\r\\na little sledge, in which little Kay sat and nodded his head; but the\\r\\nwhole was only a dream, and therefore it all vanished as soon as she\\r\\nawoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and velvet. They\\r\\noffered to let her stay at the palace, and lead a happy life; but she\\r\\nbegged to have a little carriage with a horse in front, and for a small\\r\\npair of shoes; then, she said, she would again go forth in the wide\\r\\nworld and look for Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\nShoes and a muff were given her; she was, too, dressed very nicely; and\\r\\nwhen she was about to set off, a new carriage stopped before the door.\\r\\nIt was of pure gold, and the arms of the Prince and Princess shone\\r\\nlike a star upon it; the coachman, the footmen, and the outriders, for\\r\\noutriders were there, too, all wore golden crowns. The Prince and the\\r\\nPrincess assisted her into the carriage themselves, and wished her all\\r\\nsuccess. The Raven of the woods, who was now married, accompanied her\\r\\nfor the first three miles. He sat beside Gerda, for he could not bear\\r\\nriding backwards; the other Raven stood in the doorway, and flapped her\\r\\nwings; she could not accompany Gerda, because she suffered from headache\\r\\nsince she had had a fixed appointment and ate so much. The carriage\\r\\nwas lined inside with sugar-plums, and in the seats were fruits and\\r\\ngingerbread.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Farewell! Farewell!” cried Prince and Princess; and Gerda wept, and\\r\\nthe Raven wept. Thus passed the first miles; and then the Raven bade her\\r\\nfarewell, and this was the most painful separation of all. He flew into\\r\\na tree, and beat his black wings as long as he could see the carriage,\\r\\nthat shone from afar like a sunbeam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFTH STORY. The Little Robber Maiden\\r\\n\\r\\nThey drove through the dark wood; but the carriage shone like a torch,\\r\\nand it dazzled the eyes of the robbers, so that they could not bear to\\r\\nlook at it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis gold! 'Tis gold!” they cried; and they rushed forward, seized\\r\\nthe horses, knocked down the little postilion, the coachman, and the\\r\\nservants, and pulled little Gerda out of the carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How plump, how beautiful she is! She must have been fed on\\r\\nnut-kernels,” said the old female robber, who had a long, scrubby beard,\\r\\nand bushy eyebrows that hung down over her eyes. “She is as good as a\\r\\nfatted lamb! How nice she will be!” And then she drew out a knife, the\\r\\nblade of which shone so that it was quite dreadful to behold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” cried the woman at the same moment. She had been bitten in the ear\\r\\nby her own little daughter, who hung at her back; and who was so wild\\r\\nand unmanageable, that it was quite amusing to see her. “You naughty\\r\\nchild!” said the mother: and now she had not time to kill Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She shall play with me,” said the little robber child. “She shall give\\r\\nme her muff, and her pretty frock; she shall sleep in my bed!” And then\\r\\nshe gave her mother another bite, so that she jumped, and ran round with\\r\\nthe pain; and the Robbers laughed, and said, “Look, how she is dancing\\r\\nwith the little one!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will go into the carriage,” said the little robber maiden; and she\\r\\nwould have her will, for she was very spoiled and very headstrong. She\\r\\nand Gerda got in; and then away they drove over the stumps of felled\\r\\ntrees, deeper and deeper into the woods. The little robber maiden was as\\r\\ntall as Gerda, but stronger, broader-shouldered, and of dark complexion;\\r\\nher eyes were quite black; they looked almost melancholy. She embraced\\r\\nlittle Gerda, and said, “They shall not kill you as long as I am not\\r\\ndispleased with you. You are, doubtless, a Princess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said little Gerda; who then related all that had happened to her,\\r\\nand how much she cared about little Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little robber maiden looked at her with a serious air, nodded her\\r\\nhead slightly, and said, “They shall not kill you, even if I am angry\\r\\nwith you: then I will do it myself”; and she dried Gerda's eyes, and put\\r\\nboth her hands in the handsome muff, which was so soft and warm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the carriage stopped. They were in the midst of the court-yard\\r\\nof a robber's castle. It was full of cracks from top to bottom; and out\\r\\nof the openings magpies and rooks were flying; and the great bull-dogs,\\r\\neach of which looked as if he could swallow a man, jumped up, but they\\r\\ndid not bark, for that was forbidden.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of the large, old, smoking hall burnt a great fire on the\\r\\nstone floor. The smoke disappeared under the stones, and had to seek\\r\\nits own egress. In an immense caldron soup was boiling; and rabbits and\\r\\nhares were being roasted on a spit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shall sleep with me to-night, with all my animals,” said the little\\r\\nrobber maiden. They had something to eat and drink; and then went into\\r\\na corner, where straw and carpets were lying. Beside them, on laths and\\r\\nperches, sat nearly a hundred pigeons, all asleep, seemingly; but yet\\r\\nthey moved a little when the robber maiden came. “They are all mine,”\\r\\n said she, at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs\\r\\nand shaking it so that its wings fluttered. “Kiss it,” cried the little\\r\\ngirl, and flung the pigeon in Gerda's face. “Up there is the rabble of\\r\\nthe wood,” continued she, pointing to several laths which were fastened\\r\\nbefore a hole high up in the wall; “that's the rabble; they would all\\r\\nfly away immediately, if they were not well fastened in. And here is my\\r\\ndear old Bac”; and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer, that had a\\r\\nbright copper ring round its neck, and was tethered to the spot. “We are\\r\\nobliged to lock this fellow in too, or he would make his escape. Every\\r\\nevening I tickle his neck with my sharp knife; he is so frightened at\\r\\nit!” and the little girl drew forth a long knife, from a crack in the\\r\\nwall, and let it glide over the Reindeer's neck. The poor animal kicked;\\r\\nthe girl laughed, and pulled Gerda into bed with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you intend to keep your knife while you sleep?” asked Gerda; looking\\r\\nat it rather fearfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I always sleep with the knife,” said the little robber maiden. “There\\r\\nis no knowing what may happen. But tell me now, once more, all about\\r\\nlittle Kay; and why you have started off in the wide world alone.” And\\r\\nGerda related all, from the very beginning: the Wood-pigeons cooed above\\r\\nin their cage, and the others slept. The little robber maiden wound her\\r\\narm round Gerda's neck, held the knife in the other hand, and snored so\\r\\nloud that everybody could hear her; but Gerda could not close her eyes,\\r\\nfor she did not know whether she was to live or die. The robbers sat\\r\\nround the fire, sang and drank; and the old female robber jumped about\\r\\nso, that it was quite dreadful for Gerda to see her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Wood-pigeons said, “Coo! Coo! We have seen little Kay! A white\\r\\nhen carries his sledge; he himself sat in the carriage of the Snow\\r\\nQueen, who passed here, down just over the wood, as we lay in our nest.\\r\\nShe blew upon us young ones; and all died except we two. Coo! Coo!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is that you say up there?” cried little Gerda. “Where did the Snow\\r\\nQueen go to? Do you know anything about it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is no doubt gone to Lapland; for there is always snow and ice\\r\\nthere. Only ask the Reindeer, who is tethered there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ice and snow is there! There it is, glorious and beautiful!” said the\\r\\nReindeer. “One can spring about in the large shining valleys! The Snow\\r\\nQueen has her summer-tent there; but her fixed abode is high up towards\\r\\nthe North Pole, on the Island called Spitzbergen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Kay! Poor little Kay!” sighed Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you choose to be quiet?” said the robber maiden. “If you don't, I\\r\\nshall make you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Gerda told her all that the Wood-pigeons had said; and\\r\\nthe little maiden looked very serious, but she nodded her head, and\\r\\nsaid, “That's no matter--that's no matter. Do you know where Lapland\\r\\nlies!” she asked of the Reindeer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who should know better than I?” said the animal; and his eyes rolled in\\r\\nhis head. “I was born and bred there--there I leapt about on the fields\\r\\nof snow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen,” said the robber maiden to Gerda. “You see that the men are\\r\\ngone; but my mother is still here, and will remain. However, towards\\r\\nmorning she takes a draught out of the large flask, and then she sleeps\\r\\na little: then I will do something for you.” She now jumped out of bed,\\r\\nflew to her mother; with her arms round her neck, and pulling her by the\\r\\nbeard, said, “Good morrow, my own sweet nanny-goat of a mother.” And her\\r\\nmother took hold of her nose, and pinched it till it was red and blue;\\r\\nbut this was all done out of pure love.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the mother had taken a sup at her flask, and was having a nap, the\\r\\nlittle robber maiden went to the Reindeer, and said, “I should very much\\r\\nlike to give you still many a tickling with the sharp knife, for then\\r\\nyou are so amusing; however, I will untether you, and help you out,\\r\\nso that you may go back to Lapland. But you must make good use of your\\r\\nlegs; and take this little girl for me to the palace of the Snow Queen,\\r\\nwhere her playfellow is. You have heard, I suppose, all she said; for\\r\\nshe spoke loud enough, and you were listening.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reindeer gave a bound for joy. The robber maiden lifted up little\\r\\nGerda, and took the precaution to bind her fast on the Reindeer's back;\\r\\nshe even gave her a small cushion to sit on. “Here are your worsted\\r\\nleggins, for it will be cold; but the muff I shall keep for myself, for\\r\\nit is so very pretty. But I do not wish you to be cold. Here is a pair\\r\\nof lined gloves of my mother's; they just reach up to your elbow. On\\r\\nwith them! Now you look about the hands just like my ugly old mother!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda wept for joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can't bear to see you fretting,” said the little robber maiden. “This\\r\\nis just the time when you ought to look pleased. Here are two loaves and\\r\\na ham for you, so that you won't starve.” The bread and the meat were\\r\\nfastened to the Reindeer's back; the little maiden opened the door,\\r\\ncalled in all the dogs, and then with her knife cut the rope that\\r\\nfastened the animal, and said to him, “Now, off with you; but take good\\r\\ncare of the little girl!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda stretched out her hands with the large wadded gloves towards\\r\\nthe robber maiden, and said, “Farewell!” and the Reindeer flew on over\\r\\nbush and bramble through the great wood, over moor and heath, as fast as\\r\\nhe could go.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ddsa! Ddsa!” was heard in the sky. It was just as if somebody was\\r\\nsneezing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These are my old northern-lights,” said the Reindeer, “look how they\\r\\ngleam!” And on he now sped still quicker--day and night on he went: the\\r\\nloaves were consumed, and the ham too; and now they were in Lapland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIXTH STORY. The Lapland Woman and the Finland Woman\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly they stopped before a little house, which looked very\\r\\nmiserable. The roof reached to the ground; and the door was so low, that\\r\\nthe family were obliged to creep upon their stomachs when they went in\\r\\nor out. Nobody was at home except an old Lapland woman, who was dressing\\r\\nfish by the light of an oil lamp. And the Reindeer told her the whole\\r\\nof Gerda's history, but first of all his own; for that seemed to him of\\r\\nmuch greater importance. Gerda was so chilled that she could not speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor thing,” said the Lapland woman, “you have far to run still. You\\r\\nhave more than a hundred miles to go before you get to Finland; there\\r\\nthe Snow Queen has her country-house, and burns blue lights every\\r\\nevening. I will give you a few words from me, which I will write on a\\r\\ndried haberdine, for paper I have none; this you can take with you to\\r\\nthe Finland woman, and she will be able to give you more information\\r\\nthan I can.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Gerda had warmed herself, and had eaten and drunk, the Lapland\\r\\nwoman wrote a few words on a dried haberdine, begged Gerda to take care\\r\\nof them, put her on the Reindeer, bound her fast, and away sprang the\\r\\nanimal. “Ddsa! Ddsa!” was again heard in the air; the most charming\\r\\nblue lights burned the whole night in the sky, and at last they came to\\r\\nFinland. They knocked at the chimney of the Finland woman; for as to a\\r\\ndoor, she had none.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was such a heat inside that the Finland woman herself went about\\r\\nalmost naked. She was diminutive and dirty. She immediately loosened\\r\\nlittle Gerda's clothes, pulled off her thick gloves and boots; for\\r\\notherwise the heat would have been too great--and after laying a piece\\r\\nof ice on the Reindeer's head, read what was written on the fish-skin.\\r\\nShe read it three times: she then knew it by heart; so she put the fish\\r\\ninto the cupboard--for it might very well be eaten, and she never threw\\r\\nanything away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Reindeer related his own story first, and afterwards that of\\r\\nlittle Gerda; and the Finland woman winked her eyes, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are so clever,” said the Reindeer; “you can, I know, twist all the\\r\\nwinds of the world together in a knot. If the seaman loosens one knot,\\r\\nthen he has a good wind; if a second, then it blows pretty stiffly; if\\r\\nhe undoes the third and fourth, then it rages so that the forests are\\r\\nupturned. Will you give the little maiden a potion, that she may possess\\r\\nthe strength of twelve men, and vanquish the Snow Queen?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The strength of twelve men!” said the Finland woman. “Much good that\\r\\nwould be!” Then she went to a cupboard, and drew out a large skin rolled\\r\\nup. When she had unrolled it, strange characters were to be seen written\\r\\nthereon; and the Finland woman read at such a rate that the perspiration\\r\\ntrickled down her forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda, and Gerda looked so\\r\\nimploringly with tearful eyes at the Finland woman, that she winked, and\\r\\ndrew the Reindeer aside into a corner, where they whispered together,\\r\\nwhile the animal got some fresh ice put on his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis true little Kay is at the Snow Queen's, and finds everything there\\r\\nquite to his taste; and he thinks it the very best place in the world;\\r\\nbut the reason of that is, he has a splinter of glass in his eye, and in\\r\\nhis heart. These must be got out first; otherwise he will never go back\\r\\nto mankind, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But can you give little Gerda nothing to take which will endue her with\\r\\npower over the whole?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can give her no more power than what she has already. Don't you see\\r\\nhow great it is? Don't you see how men and animals are forced to serve\\r\\nher; how well she gets through the world barefooted? She must not hear\\r\\nof her power from us; that power lies in her heart, because she is\\r\\na sweet and innocent child! If she cannot get to the Snow Queen by\\r\\nherself, and rid little Kay of the glass, we cannot help her. Two miles\\r\\nhence the garden of the Snow Queen begins; thither you may carry the\\r\\nlittle girl. Set her down by the large bush with red berries, standing\\r\\nin the snow; don't stay talking, but hasten back as fast as possible.”\\r\\n And now the Finland woman placed little Gerda on the Reindeer's back,\\r\\nand off he ran with all imaginable speed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! I have not got my boots! I have not brought my gloves!” cried\\r\\nlittle Gerda. She remarked she was without them from the cutting frost;\\r\\nbut the Reindeer dared not stand still; on he ran till he came to the\\r\\ngreat bush with the red berries, and there he set Gerda down, kissed her\\r\\nmouth, while large bright tears flowed from the animal's eyes, and then\\r\\nback he went as fast as possible. There stood poor Gerda now, without\\r\\nshoes or gloves, in the very middle of dreadful icy Finland.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ran on as fast as she could. There then came a whole regiment of\\r\\nsnow-flakes, but they did not fall from above, and they were quite\\r\\nbright and shining from the Aurora Borealis. The flakes ran along\\r\\nthe ground, and the nearer they came the larger they grew. Gerda well\\r\\nremembered how large and strange the snow-flakes appeared when she\\r\\nonce saw them through a magnifying-glass; but now they were large and\\r\\nterrific in another manner--they were all alive. They were the outposts\\r\\nof the Snow Queen. They had the most wondrous shapes; some looked like\\r\\nlarge ugly porcupines; others like snakes knotted together, with their\\r\\nheads sticking out; and others, again, like small fat bears, with the\\r\\nhair standing on end: all were of dazzling whiteness--all were living\\r\\nsnow-flakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Gerda repeated the Lord's Prayer. The cold was so intense that\\r\\nshe could see her own breath, which came like smoke out of her mouth. It\\r\\ngrew thicker and thicker, and took the form of little angels, that grew\\r\\nmore and more when they touched the earth. All had helms on their heads,\\r\\nand lances and shields in their hands; they increased in numbers; and\\r\\nwhen Gerda had finished the Lord's Prayer, she was surrounded by a whole\\r\\nlegion. They thrust at the horrid snow-flakes with their spears, so that\\r\\nthey flew into a thousand pieces; and little Gerda walked on bravely and\\r\\nin security. The angels patted her hands and feet; and then she felt the\\r\\ncold less, and went on quickly towards the palace of the Snow Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now we shall see how Kay fared. He never thought of Gerda, and least\\r\\nof all that she was standing before the palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSEVENTH STORY. What Took Place in the Palace of the Snow Queen, and what\\r\\nHappened Afterward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe walls of the palace were of driving snow, and the windows and doors\\r\\nof cutting winds. There were more than a hundred halls there, according\\r\\nas the snow was driven by the winds. The largest was many miles in\\r\\nextent; all were lighted up by the powerful Aurora Borealis, and all\\r\\nwere so large, so empty, so icy cold, and so resplendent! Mirth never\\r\\nreigned there; there was never even a little bear-ball, with the storm\\r\\nfor music, while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off\\r\\ntheir steps. Never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes; vast,\\r\\ncold, and empty were the halls of the Snow Queen. The northern-lights\\r\\nshone with such precision that one could tell exactly when they were\\r\\nat their highest or lowest degree of brightness. In the middle of the\\r\\nempty, endless hall of snow, was a frozen lake; it was cracked in a\\r\\nthousand pieces, but each piece was so like the other, that it seemed\\r\\nthe work of a cunning artificer. In the middle of this lake sat the Snow\\r\\nQueen when she was at home; and then she said she was sitting in the\\r\\nMirror of Understanding, and that this was the only one and the best\\r\\nthing in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Kay was quite blue, yes nearly black with cold; but he did not\\r\\nobserve it, for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body,\\r\\nand his heart was a lump of ice. He was dragging along some pointed\\r\\nflat pieces of ice, which he laid together in all possible ways, for he\\r\\nwanted to make something with them; just as we have little flat pieces\\r\\nof wood to make geometrical figures with, called the Chinese Puzzle.\\r\\nKay made all sorts of figures, the most complicated, for it was\\r\\nan ice-puzzle for the understanding. In his eyes the figures were\\r\\nextraordinarily beautiful, and of the utmost importance; for the bit\\r\\nof glass which was in his eye caused this. He found whole figures which\\r\\nrepresented a written word; but he never could manage to represent just\\r\\nthe word he wanted--that word was “eternity”; and the Snow Queen had\\r\\nsaid, “If you can discover that figure, you shall be your own master,\\r\\nand I will make you a present of the whole world and a pair of new\\r\\nskates.” But he could not find it out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am going now to warm lands,” said the Snow Queen. “I must have a look\\r\\ndown into the black caldrons.” It was the volcanoes Vesuvius and Etna\\r\\nthat she meant. “I will just give them a coating of white, for that is\\r\\nas it ought to be; besides, it is good for the oranges and the grapes.”\\r\\n And then away she flew, and Kay sat quite alone in the empty halls of\\r\\nice that were miles long, and looked at the blocks of ice, and thought\\r\\nand thought till his skull was almost cracked. There he sat quite\\r\\nbenumbed and motionless; one would have imagined he was frozen to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly little Gerda stepped through the great portal into the palace.\\r\\nThe gate was formed of cutting winds; but Gerda repeated her evening\\r\\nprayer, and the winds were laid as though they slept; and the little\\r\\nmaiden entered the vast, empty, cold halls. There she beheld Kay: she\\r\\nrecognised him, flew to embrace him, and cried out, her arms firmly\\r\\nholding him the while, “Kay, sweet little Kay! Have I then found you at\\r\\nlast?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he sat quite still, benumbed and cold. Then little Gerda shed\\r\\nburning tears; and they fell on his bosom, they penetrated to his\\r\\nheart, they thawed the lumps of ice, and consumed the splinters of the\\r\\nlooking-glass; he looked at her, and she sang the hymn:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there\\r\\nthe children to greet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHereupon Kay burst into tears; he wept so much that the splinter rolled\\r\\nout of his eye, and he recognised her, and shouted, “Gerda, sweet little\\r\\nGerda! Where have you been so long? And where have I been?” He looked\\r\\nround him. “How cold it is here!” said he. “How empty and cold!” And he\\r\\nheld fast by Gerda, who laughed and wept for joy. It was so beautiful,\\r\\nthat even the blocks of ice danced about for joy; and when they were\\r\\ntired and laid themselves down, they formed exactly the letters which\\r\\nthe Snow Queen had told him to find out; so now he was his own master,\\r\\nand he would have the whole world and a pair of new skates into the\\r\\nbargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerda kissed his cheeks, and they grew quite blooming; she kissed his\\r\\neyes, and they shone like her own; she kissed his hands and feet, and he\\r\\nwas again well and merry. The Snow Queen might come back as soon as she\\r\\nliked; there stood his discharge written in resplendent masses of ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took each other by the hand, and wandered forth out of the large\\r\\nhall; they talked of their old grandmother, and of the roses upon the\\r\\nroof; and wherever they went, the winds ceased raging, and the sun burst\\r\\nforth. And when they reached the bush with the red berries, they found\\r\\nthe Reindeer waiting for them. He had brought another, a young one, with\\r\\nhim, whose udder was filled with milk, which he gave to the little ones,\\r\\nand kissed their lips. They then carried Kay and Gerda--first to the\\r\\nFinland woman, where they warmed themselves in the warm room, and\\r\\nlearned what they were to do on their journey home; and they went to\\r\\nthe Lapland woman, who made some new clothes for them and repaired their\\r\\nsledges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reindeer and the young hind leaped along beside them, and\\r\\naccompanied them to the boundary of the country. Here the first\\r\\nvegetation peeped forth; here Kay and Gerda took leave of the Lapland\\r\\nwoman. “Farewell! Farewell!” they all said. And the first green buds\\r\\nappeared, the first little birds began to chirrup; and out of the wood\\r\\ncame, riding on a magnificent horse, which Gerda knew (it was one of the\\r\\nleaders in the golden carriage), a young damsel with a bright-red cap on\\r\\nher head, and armed with pistols. It was the little robber maiden, who,\\r\\ntired of being at home, had determined to make a journey to the north;\\r\\nand afterwards in another direction, if that did not please her. She\\r\\nrecognised Gerda immediately, and Gerda knew her too. It was a joyful\\r\\nmeeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a fine fellow for tramping about,” said she to little Kay; “I\\r\\nshould like to know, faith, if you deserve that one should run from one\\r\\nend of the world to the other for your sake?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Gerda patted her cheeks, and inquired for the Prince and Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are gone abroad,” said the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the Raven?” asked little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! The Raven is dead,” she answered. “His tame sweetheart is a\\r\\nwidow, and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg; she laments most\\r\\npiteously, but it's all mere talk and stuff! Now tell me what you've\\r\\nbeen doing and how you managed to catch him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda and Kay both told their story.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd “Schnipp-schnapp-schnurre-basselurre,” said the robber maiden; and\\r\\nshe took the hands of each, and promised that if she should some day\\r\\npass through the town where they lived, she would come and visit them;\\r\\nand then away she rode. Kay and Gerda took each other's hand: it was\\r\\nlovely spring weather, with abundance of flowers and of verdure. The\\r\\nchurch-bells rang, and the children recognised the high towers, and the\\r\\nlarge town; it was that in which they dwelt. They entered and hastened\\r\\nup to their grandmother's room, where everything was standing as\\r\\nformerly. The clock said “tick! tack!” and the finger moved round; but\\r\\nas they entered, they remarked that they were now grown up. The roses\\r\\non the leads hung blooming in at the open window; there stood the little\\r\\nchildren's chairs, and Kay and Gerda sat down on them, holding each\\r\\nother by the hand; they both had forgotten the cold empty splendor of\\r\\nthe Snow Queen, as though it had been a dream. The grandmother sat in\\r\\nthe bright sunshine, and read aloud from the Bible: “Unless ye become as\\r\\nlittle children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Kay and Gerda looked in each other's eyes, and all at once they\\r\\nunderstood the old hymn:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there\\r\\nthe children to greet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere sat the two grown-up persons; grown-up, and yet children; children\\r\\nat least in heart; and it was summer-time; summer, glorious summer!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LEAP-FROG\\r\\n\\r\\nA Flea, a Grasshopper, and a Leap-frog once wanted to see which could\\r\\njump highest; and they invited the whole world, and everybody else\\r\\nbesides who chose to come to see the festival. Three famous jumpers were\\r\\nthey, as everyone would say, when they all met together in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will give my daughter to him who jumps highest,” exclaimed the King;\\r\\n“for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump for.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flea was the first to step forward. He had exquisite manners, and\\r\\nbowed to the company on all sides; for he had noble blood, and was,\\r\\nmoreover, accustomed to the society of man alone; and that makes a great\\r\\ndifference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the Grasshopper. He was considerably heavier, but he was\\r\\nwell-mannered, and wore a green uniform, which he had by right of birth;\\r\\nhe said, moreover, that he belonged to a very ancient Egyptian family,\\r\\nand that in the house where he then was, he was thought much of. The\\r\\nfact was, he had been just brought out of the fields, and put in a\\r\\npasteboard house, three stories high, all made of court-cards, with the\\r\\ncolored side inwards; and doors and windows cut out of the body of\\r\\nthe Queen of Hearts. “I sing so well,” said he, “that sixteen native\\r\\ngrasshoppers who have chirped from infancy, and yet got no house built\\r\\nof cards to live in, grew thinner than they were before for sheer\\r\\nvexation when they heard me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was thus that the Flea and the Grasshopper gave an account of\\r\\nthemselves, and thought they were quite good enough to marry a Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Leap-frog said nothing; but people gave it as their opinion, that\\r\\nhe therefore thought the more; and when the housedog snuffed at him\\r\\nwith his nose, he confessed the Leap-frog was of good family. The old\\r\\ncouncillor, who had had three orders given him to make him hold his\\r\\ntongue, asserted that the Leap-frog was a prophet; for that one could\\r\\nsee on his back, if there would be a severe or mild winter, and that\\r\\nwas what one could not see even on the back of the man who writes the\\r\\nalmanac.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say nothing, it is true,” exclaimed the King; “but I have my own\\r\\nopinion, notwithstanding.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the trial was to take place. The Flea jumped so high that nobody\\r\\ncould see where he went to; so they all asserted he had not jumped at\\r\\nall; and that was dishonorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grasshopper jumped only half as high; but he leaped into the King's\\r\\nface, who said that was ill-mannered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Leap-frog stood still for a long time lost in thought; it was\\r\\nbelieved at last he would not jump at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I only hope he is not unwell,” said the house-dog; when, pop! he made a\\r\\njump all on one side into the lap of the Princess, who was sitting on a\\r\\nlittle golden stool close by.\\r\\n\\r\\nHereupon the King said, “There is nothing above my daughter; therefore\\r\\nto bound up to her is the highest jump that can be made; but for this,\\r\\none must possess understanding, and the Leap-frog has shown that he has\\r\\nunderstanding. He is brave and intellectual.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so he won the Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It's all the same to me,” said the Flea. “She may have the old\\r\\nLeap-frog, for all I care. I jumped the highest; but in this world\\r\\nmerit seldom meets its reward. A fine exterior is what people look at\\r\\nnow-a-days.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flea then went into foreign service, where, it is said, he was\\r\\nkilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grasshopper sat without on a green bank, and reflected on worldly\\r\\nthings; and he said too, “Yes, a fine exterior is everything--a fine\\r\\nexterior is what people care about.” And then he began chirping his\\r\\npeculiar melancholy song, from which we have taken this history; and\\r\\nwhich may, very possibly, be all untrue, although it does stand here\\r\\nprinted in black and white.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ELDERBUSH\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a little boy who had taken cold. He had\\r\\ngone out and got his feet wet; though nobody could imagine how it had\\r\\nhappened, for it was quite dry weather. So his mother undressed him, put\\r\\nhim to bed, and had the tea-pot brought in, to make him a good cup of\\r\\nElderflower tea. Just at that moment the merry old man came in who\\r\\nlived up a-top of the house all alone; for he had neither wife nor\\r\\nchildren--but he liked children very much, and knew so many fairy tales,\\r\\nthat it was quite delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now drink your tea,” said the boy's mother; “then, perhaps, you may\\r\\nhear a fairy tale.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I had but something new to tell,” said the old man. “But how did the\\r\\nchild get his feet wet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is the very thing that nobody can make out,” said his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Am I to hear a fairy tale?” asked the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, if you can tell me exactly--for I must know that first--how deep\\r\\nthe gutter is in the little street opposite, that you pass through in\\r\\ngoing to school.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just up to the middle of my boot,” said the child; “but then I must go\\r\\ninto the deep hole.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, ah! That's where the wet feet came from,” said the old man. “I\\r\\nought now to tell you a story; but I don't know any more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can make one in a moment,” said the little boy. “My mother says\\r\\nthat all you look at can be turned into a fairy tale: and that you can\\r\\nfind a story in everything.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but such tales and stories are good for nothing. The right sort\\r\\ncome of themselves; they tap at my forehead and say, 'Here we are.'”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Won't there be a tap soon?” asked the little boy. And his mother\\r\\nlaughed, put some Elder-flowers in the tea-pot, and poured boiling water\\r\\nupon them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do tell me something! Pray do!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, if a fairy tale would come of its own accord; but they are proud\\r\\nand haughty, and come only when they choose. Stop!” said he, all on a\\r\\nsudden. “I have it! Pay attention! There is one in the tea-pot!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the little boy looked at the tea-pot. The cover rose more and more;\\r\\nand the Elder-flowers came forth so fresh and white, and shot up long\\r\\nbranches. Out of the spout even did they spread themselves on all sides,\\r\\nand grew larger and larger; it was a splendid Elderbush, a whole tree;\\r\\nand it reached into the very bed, and pushed the curtains aside. How\\r\\nit bloomed! And what an odour! In the middle of the bush sat a\\r\\nfriendly-looking old woman in a most strange dress. It was quite\\r\\ngreen, like the leaves of the elder, and was trimmed with large white\\r\\nElder-flowers; so that at first one could not tell whether it was a\\r\\nstuff, or a natural green and real flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What's that woman's name?” asked the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Greeks and Romans,” said the old man, “called her a Dryad; but that\\r\\nwe do not understand. The people who live in the New Booths [*] have a much\\r\\nbetter name for her; they call her 'old Granny'--and she it is to\\r\\nwhom you are to pay attention. Now listen, and look at the beautiful\\r\\nElderbush.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * A row of buildings for seamen in Copenhagen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just such another large blooming Elder Tree stands near the New Booths.\\r\\nIt grew there in the corner of a little miserable court-yard; and under\\r\\nit sat, of an afternoon, in the most splendid sunshine, two old\\r\\npeople; an old, old seaman, and his old, old wife. They had\\r\\ngreat-grand-children, and were soon to celebrate the fiftieth\\r\\nanniversary of their marriage; but they could not exactly recollect the\\r\\ndate: and old Granny sat in the tree, and looked as pleased as now. 'I\\r\\nknow the date,' said she; but those below did not hear her, for they\\r\\nwere talking about old times.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes, can't you remember when we were very little,' said the old\\r\\nseaman, 'and ran and played about? It was the very same court-yard where\\r\\nwe now are, and we stuck slips in the ground, and made a garden.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'I remember it well,' said the old woman; 'I remember it quite well. We\\r\\nwatered the slips, and one of them was an Elderbush. It took root, put\\r\\nforth green shoots, and grew up to be the large tree under which we old\\r\\nfolks are now sitting.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'To be sure,' said he. 'And there in the corner stood a waterpail,\\r\\nwhere I used to swim my boats.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'True; but first we went to school to learn somewhat,' said she; 'and\\r\\nthen we were confirmed. We both cried; but in the afternoon we went up\\r\\nthe Round Tower, and looked down on Copenhagen, and far, far away over\\r\\nthe water; then we went to Friedericksberg, where the King and the Queen\\r\\nwere sailing about in their splendid barges.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'But I had a different sort of sailing to that, later; and that, too,\\r\\nfor many a year; a long way off, on great voyages.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes, many a time have I wept for your sake,' said she. 'I thought you\\r\\nwere dead and gone, and lying down in the deep waters. Many a night have\\r\\nI got up to see if the wind had not changed: and changed it had, sure\\r\\nenough; but you never came. I remember so well one day, when the rain\\r\\nwas pouring down in torrents, the scavengers were before the house where\\r\\nI was in service, and I had come up with the dust, and remained standing\\r\\nat the door--it was dreadful weather--when just as I was there, the\\r\\npostman came and gave me a letter. It was from you! What a tour that\\r\\nletter had made! I opened it instantly and read: I laughed and wept.\\r\\nI was so happy. In it I read that you were in warm lands where the\\r\\ncoffee-tree grows. What a blessed land that must be! You related so\\r\\nmuch, and I saw it all the while the rain was pouring down, and I\\r\\nstanding there with the dust-box. At the same moment came someone who\\r\\nembraced me.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes; but you gave him a good box on his ear that made it tingle!'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'But I did not know it was you. You arrived as soon as your letter,\\r\\nand you were so handsome--that you still are--and had a long yellow silk\\r\\nhandkerchief round your neck, and a bran new hat on; oh, you were so\\r\\ndashing! Good heavens! What weather it was, and what a state the street\\r\\nwas in!'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'And then we married,' said he. 'Don't you remember? And then we\\r\\nhad our first little boy, and then Mary, and Nicholas, and Peter, and\\r\\nChristian.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes, and how they all grew up to be honest people, and were beloved by\\r\\neverybody.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'And their children also have children,' said the old sailor; 'yes,\\r\\nthose are our grand-children, full of strength and vigor. It was,\\r\\nmethinks about this season that we had our wedding.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes, this very day is the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage,' said\\r\\nold Granny, sticking her head between the two old people; who thought\\r\\nit was their neighbor who nodded to them. They looked at each other and\\r\\nheld one another by the hand. Soon after came their children, and their\\r\\ngrand-children; for they knew well enough that it was the day of the\\r\\nfiftieth anniversary, and had come with their gratulations that very\\r\\nmorning; but the old people had forgotten it, although they were able\\r\\nto remember all that had happened many years ago. And the Elderbush sent\\r\\nforth a strong odour in the sun, that was just about to set, and shone\\r\\nright in the old people's faces. They both looked so rosy-cheeked; and\\r\\nthe youngest of the grandchildren danced around them, and called out\\r\\nquite delighted, that there was to be something very splendid that\\r\\nevening--they were all to have hot potatoes. And old Nanny nodded in the\\r\\nbush, and shouted 'hurrah!' with the rest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But that is no fairy tale,” said the little boy, who was listening to\\r\\nthe story.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The thing is, you must understand it,” said the narrator; “let us ask\\r\\nold Nanny.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was no fairy tale, 'tis true,” said old Nanny; “but now it's\\r\\ncoming. The most wonderful fairy tales grow out of that which is\\r\\nreality; were that not the case, you know, my magnificent Elderbush\\r\\ncould not have grown out of the tea-pot.” And then she took the little\\r\\nboy out of bed, laid him on her bosom, and the branches of the Elder\\r\\nTree, full of flowers, closed around her. They sat in an aerial\\r\\ndwelling, and it flew with them through the air. Oh, it was wondrous\\r\\nbeautiful! Old Nanny had grown all of a sudden a young and pretty\\r\\nmaiden; but her robe was still the same green stuff with white flowers,\\r\\nwhich she had worn before. On her bosom she had a real Elderflower,\\r\\nand in her yellow waving hair a wreath of the flowers; her eyes were so\\r\\nlarge and blue that it was a pleasure to look at them; she kissed the\\r\\nboy, and now they were of the same age and felt alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nHand in hand they went out of the bower, and they were standing in the\\r\\nbeautiful garden of their home. Near the green lawn papa's walking-stick\\r\\nwas tied, and for the little ones it seemed to be endowed with life; for\\r\\nas soon as they got astride it, the round polished knob was turned into\\r\\na magnificent neighing head, a long black mane fluttered in the breeze,\\r\\nand four slender yet strong legs shot out. The animal was strong and\\r\\nhandsome, and away they went at full gallop round the lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Huzza! Now we are riding miles off,” said the boy. “We are riding away\\r\\nto the castle where we were last year!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on they rode round the grass-plot; and the little maiden, who, we\\r\\nknow, was no one else but old Nanny, kept on crying out, “Now we are in\\r\\nthe country! Don't you see the farm-house yonder? And there is an Elder\\r\\nTree standing beside it; and the cock is scraping away the earth for the\\r\\nhens, look, how he struts! And now we are close to the church. It lies\\r\\nhigh upon the hill, between the large oak-trees, one of which is half\\r\\ndecayed. And now we are by the smithy, where the fire is blazing, and\\r\\nwhere the half-naked men are banging with their hammers till the sparks\\r\\nfly about. Away! away! To the beautiful country-seat!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all that the little maiden, who sat behind on the stick, spoke of,\\r\\nflew by in reality. The boy saw it all, and yet they were only going\\r\\nround the grass-plot. Then they played in a side avenue, and marked out\\r\\na little garden on the earth; and they took Elder-blossoms from their\\r\\nhair, planted them, and they grew just like those the old people planted\\r\\nwhen they were children, as related before. They went hand in hand, as\\r\\nthe old people had done when they were children; but not to the Round\\r\\nTower, or to Friedericksberg; no, the little damsel wound her arms round\\r\\nthe boy, and then they flew far away through all Denmark. And spring\\r\\ncame, and summer; and then it was autumn, and then winter; and a\\r\\nthousand pictures were reflected in the eye and in the heart of the boy;\\r\\nand the little girl always sang to him, “This you will never forget.”\\r\\n And during their whole flight the Elder Tree smelt so sweet and odorous;\\r\\nhe remarked the roses and the fresh beeches, but the Elder Tree had\\r\\na more wondrous fragrance, for its flowers hung on the breast of the\\r\\nlittle maiden; and there, too, did he often lay his head during the\\r\\nflight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is lovely here in spring!” said the young maiden. And they stood in\\r\\na beech-wood that had just put on its first green, where the woodroof [*]\\r\\nat their feet sent forth its fragrance, and the pale-red anemony looked\\r\\nso pretty among the verdure. “Oh, would it were always spring in the\\r\\nsweetly-smelling Danish beech-forests!”\\r\\n\\r\\n     * Asperula odorata.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is lovely here in summer!” said she. And she flew past old castles\\r\\nof by-gone days of chivalry, where the red walls and the embattled\\r\\ngables were mirrored in the canal, where the swans were swimming, and\\r\\npeered up into the old cool avenues. In the fields the corn was waving\\r\\nlike the sea; in the ditches red and yellow flowers were growing; while\\r\\nwild-drone flowers, and blooming convolvuluses were creeping in the\\r\\nhedges; and towards evening the moon rose round and large, and the\\r\\nhaycocks in the meadows smelt so sweetly. “This one never forgets!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is lovely here in autumn!” said the little maiden. And suddenly the\\r\\natmosphere grew as blue again as before; the forest grew red, and green,\\r\\nand yellow-colored. The dogs came leaping along, and whole flocks of\\r\\nwild-fowl flew over the cairn, where blackberry-bushes were hanging\\r\\nround the old stones. The sea was dark blue, covered with ships full\\r\\nof white sails; and in the barn old women, maidens, and children were\\r\\nsitting picking hops into a large cask; the young sang songs, but the\\r\\nold told fairy tales of mountain-sprites and soothsayers. Nothing could\\r\\nbe more charming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is delightful here in winter!” said the little maiden. And all the\\r\\ntrees were covered with hoar-frost; they looked like white corals; the\\r\\nsnow crackled under foot, as if one had new boots on; and one falling\\r\\nstar after the other was seen in the sky. The Christmas-tree was lighted\\r\\nin the room; presents were there, and good-humor reigned. In the country\\r\\nthe violin sounded in the room of the peasant; the newly-baked cakes\\r\\nwere attacked; even the poorest child said, “It is really delightful\\r\\nhere in winter!”\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, it was delightful; and the little maiden showed the boy everything;\\r\\nand the Elder Tree still was fragrant, and the red flag, with the white\\r\\ncross, was still waving: the flag under which the old seaman in the New\\r\\nBooths had sailed. And the boy grew up to be a lad, and was to go forth\\r\\nin the wide world-far, far away to warm lands, where the coffee-tree\\r\\ngrows; but at his departure the little maiden took an Elder-blossom from\\r\\nher bosom, and gave it him to keep; and it was placed between the leaves\\r\\nof his Prayer-Book; and when in foreign lands he opened the book, it\\r\\nwas always at the place where the keepsake-flower lay; and the more he\\r\\nlooked at it, the fresher it became; he felt as it were, the fragrance\\r\\nof the Danish groves; and from among the leaves of the flowers he could\\r\\ndistinctly see the little maiden, peeping forth with her bright blue\\r\\neyes--and then she whispered, “It is delightful here in Spring, Summer,\\r\\nAutumn, and Winter”; and a hundred visions glided before his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus passed many years, and he was now an old man, and sat with his old\\r\\nwife under the blooming tree. They held each other by the hand, as the\\r\\nold grand-father and grand-mother yonder in the New Booths did, and they\\r\\ntalked exactly like them of old times, and of the fiftieth anniversary\\r\\nof their wedding. The little maiden, with the blue eyes, and with\\r\\nElder-blossoms in her hair, sat in the tree, nodded to both of them,\\r\\nand said, “To-day is the fiftieth anniversary!” And then she took two\\r\\nflowers out of her hair, and kissed them. First, they shone like silver,\\r\\nthen like gold; and when they laid them on the heads of the old people,\\r\\neach flower became a golden crown. So there they both sat, like a king\\r\\nand a queen, under the fragrant tree, that looked exactly like an elder:\\r\\nthe old man told his wife the story of “Old Nanny,” as it had been told\\r\\nhim when a boy. And it seemed to both of them it contained much that\\r\\nresembled their own history; and those parts that were like it pleased\\r\\nthem best.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thus it is,” said the little maiden in the tree, “some call me 'Old\\r\\nNanny,' others a 'Dryad,' but, in reality, my name is 'Remembrance';\\r\\n'tis I who sit in the tree that grows and grows! I can remember; I can\\r\\ntell things! Let me see if you have my flower still?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the old man opened his Prayer-Book. There lay the Elder-blossom,\\r\\nas fresh as if it had been placed there but a short time before; and\\r\\nRemembrance nodded, and the old people, decked with crowns of gold, sat\\r\\nin the flush of the evening sun. They closed their eyes, and--and--!\\r\\nYes, that's the end of the story!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boy lay in his bed; he did not know if he had dreamed or\\r\\nnot, or if he had been listening while someone told him the story. The\\r\\ntea-pot was standing on the table, but no Elder Tree was growing out\\r\\nof it! And the old man, who had been talking, was just on the point of\\r\\ngoing out at the door, and he did go.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How splendid that was!” said the little boy. “Mother, I have been to\\r\\nwarm countries.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I should think,” said his mother. “When one has drunk two good\\r\\ncupfuls of Elder-flower tea, 'tis likely enough one goes into warm\\r\\nclimates”; and she tucked him up nicely, least he should take cold. “You\\r\\nhave had a good sleep while I have been sitting here, and arguing with\\r\\nhim whether it was a story or a fairy tale.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And where is old Nanny?” asked the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the tea-pot,” said his mother; “and there she may remain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BELL\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople said “The Evening Bell is sounding, the sun is setting.” For a\\r\\nstrange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town.\\r\\nIt was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a\\r\\nmoment, for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude\\r\\nmade too great a noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose persons who were walking outside the town, where the houses were\\r\\nfarther apart, with gardens or little fields between them, could see\\r\\nthe evening sky still better, and heard the sound of the bell much\\r\\nmore distinctly. It was as if the tones came from a church in the still\\r\\nforest; people looked thitherward, and felt their minds attuned most\\r\\nsolemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time passed, and people said to each other--“I wonder if there\\r\\nis a church out in the wood? The bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet;\\r\\nlet us stroll thither, and examine the matter nearer.” And the rich\\r\\npeople drove out, and the poor walked, but the way seemed strangely\\r\\nlong to them; and when they came to a clump of willows which grew on the\\r\\nskirts of the forest, they sat down, and looked up at the long\\r\\nbranches, and fancied they were now in the depth of the green wood. The\\r\\nconfectioner of the town came out, and set up his booth there; and soon\\r\\nafter came another confectioner, who hung a bell over his stand, as\\r\\na sign or ornament, but it had no clapper, and it was tarred over to\\r\\npreserve it from the rain. When all the people returned home, they said\\r\\nit had been very romantic, and that it was quite a different sort of\\r\\nthing to a pic-nic or tea-party. There were three persons who asserted\\r\\nthey had penetrated to the end of the forest, and that they had always\\r\\nheard the wonderful sounds of the bell, but it had seemed to them as if\\r\\nit had come from the town. One wrote a whole poem about it, and said the\\r\\nbell sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child, and\\r\\nthat no melody was sweeter than the tones of the bell. The king of the\\r\\ncountry was also observant of it, and vowed that he who could discover\\r\\nwhence the sounds proceeded, should have the title of “Universal\\r\\nBell-ringer,” even if it were not really a bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany persons now went to the wood, for the sake of getting the place,\\r\\nbut one only returned with a sort of explanation; for nobody went far\\r\\nenough, that one not further than the others. However, he said that\\r\\nthe sound proceeded from a very large owl, in a hollow tree; a sort of\\r\\nlearned owl, that continually knocked its head against the branches. But\\r\\nwhether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree, that no\\r\\none could say with certainty. So now he got the place of “Universal\\r\\nBell-ringer,” and wrote yearly a short treatise “On the Owl”; but\\r\\neverybody was just as wise as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the day of confirmation. The clergyman had spoken so touchingly,\\r\\nthe children who were confirmed had been greatly moved; it was\\r\\nan eventful day for them; from children they become all at once\\r\\ngrown-up-persons; it was as if their infant souls were now to fly all\\r\\nat once into persons with more understanding. The sun was shining\\r\\ngloriously; the children that had been confirmed went out of the town;\\r\\nand from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell\\r\\nwith wonderful distinctness. They all immediately felt a wish to go\\r\\nthither; all except three. One of them had to go home to try on a\\r\\nball-dress; for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her\\r\\nto be confirmed this time, for otherwise she would not have come;\\r\\nthe other was a poor boy, who had borrowed his coat and boots to be\\r\\nconfirmed in from the innkeeper's son, and he was to give them back by\\r\\na certain hour; the third said that he never went to a strange place\\r\\nif his parents were not with him--that he had always been a good boy\\r\\nhitherto, and would still be so now that he was confirmed, and that one\\r\\nought not to laugh at him for it: the others, however, did make fun of\\r\\nhim, after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three, therefore, that did not go; the others hastened on.\\r\\nThe sun shone, the birds sang, and the children sang too, and each held\\r\\nthe other by the hand; for as yet they had none of them any high office,\\r\\nand were all of equal rank in the eye of God.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut two of the youngest soon grew tired, and both returned to town; two\\r\\nlittle girls sat down, and twined garlands, so they did not go either;\\r\\nand when the others reached the willow-tree, where the confectioner was,\\r\\nthey said, “Now we are there! In reality the bell does not exist; it is\\r\\nonly a fancy that people have taken into their heads!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same moment the bell sounded deep in the wood, so clear and\\r\\nsolemnly that five or six determined to penetrate somewhat further. It\\r\\nwas so thick, and the foliage so dense, that it was quite fatiguing\\r\\nto proceed. Woodroof and anemonies grew almost too high; blooming\\r\\nconvolvuluses and blackberry-bushes hung in long garlands from tree to\\r\\ntree, where the nightingale sang and the sunbeams were playing: it was\\r\\nvery beautiful, but it was no place for girls to go; their clothes would\\r\\nget so torn. Large blocks of stone lay there, overgrown with moss of\\r\\nevery color; the fresh spring bubbled forth, and made a strange gurgling\\r\\nsound.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That surely cannot be the bell,” said one of the children, lying down\\r\\nand listening. “This must be looked to.” So he remained, and let the\\r\\nothers go on without him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey afterwards came to a little house, made of branches and the bark of\\r\\ntrees; a large wild apple-tree bent over it, as if it would shower down\\r\\nall its blessings on the roof, where roses were blooming. The long stems\\r\\ntwined round the gable, on which there hung a small bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas it that which people had heard? Yes, everybody was unanimous on the\\r\\nsubject, except one, who said that the bell was too small and too fine\\r\\nto be heard at so great a distance, and besides it was very different\\r\\ntones to those that could move a human heart in such a manner. It was a\\r\\nking's son who spoke; whereon the others said, “Such people always want\\r\\nto be wiser than everybody else.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now let him go on alone; and as he went, his breast was filled more\\r\\nand more with the forest solitude; but he still heard the little bell\\r\\nwith which the others were so satisfied, and now and then, when the\\r\\nwind blew, he could also hear the people singing who were sitting at tea\\r\\nwhere the confectioner had his tent; but the deep sound of the bell rose\\r\\nlouder; it was almost as if an organ were accompanying it, and the tones\\r\\ncame from the left hand, the side where the heart is placed. A rustling\\r\\nwas heard in the bushes, and a little boy stood before the King's Son, a\\r\\nboy in wooden shoes, and with so short a jacket that one could see what\\r\\nlong wrists he had. Both knew each other: the boy was that one among\\r\\nthe children who could not come because he had to go home and return his\\r\\njacket and boots to the innkeeper's son. This he had done, and was now\\r\\ngoing on in wooden shoes and in his humble dress, for the bell sounded\\r\\nwith so deep a tone, and with such strange power, that proceed he must.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, then, we can go together,” said the King's Son. But the poor\\r\\nchild that had been confirmed was quite ashamed; he looked at his wooden\\r\\nshoes, pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket, and said that he was\\r\\nafraid he could not walk so fast; besides, he thought that the bell must\\r\\nbe looked for to the right; for that was the place where all sorts of\\r\\nbeautiful things were to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But there we shall not meet,” said the King's Son, nodding at the same\\r\\ntime to the poor boy, who went into the darkest, thickest part of the\\r\\nwood, where thorns tore his humble dress, and scratched his face and\\r\\nhands and feet till they bled. The King's Son got some scratches too;\\r\\nbut the sun shone on his path, and it is him that we will follow, for he\\r\\nwas an excellent and resolute youth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must and will find the bell,” said he, “even if I am obliged to go to\\r\\nthe end of the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ugly apes sat upon the trees, and grinned. “Shall we thrash him?”\\r\\n said they. “Shall we thrash him? He is the son of a king!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on he went, without being disheartened, deeper and deeper into the\\r\\nwood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing. There stood white\\r\\nlilies with blood-red stamina, skyblue tulips, which shone as they waved\\r\\nin the winds, and apple-trees, the apples of which looked exactly like\\r\\nlarge soapbubbles: so only think how the trees must have sparkled in the\\r\\nsunshine! Around the nicest green meads, where the deer were playing in\\r\\nthe grass, grew magnificent oaks and beeches; and if the bark of one of\\r\\nthe trees was cracked, there grass and long creeping plants grew in\\r\\nthe crevices. And there were large calm lakes there too, in which white\\r\\nswans were swimming, and beat the air with their wings. The King's Son\\r\\noften stood still and listened. He thought the bell sounded from the\\r\\ndepths of these still lakes; but then he remarked again that the tone\\r\\nproceeded not from there, but farther off, from out the depths of the\\r\\nforest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun now set: the atmosphere glowed like fire. It was still in the\\r\\nwoods, so very still; and he fell on his knees, sung his evening hymn,\\r\\nand said: “I cannot find what I seek; the sun is going down, and night\\r\\nis coming--the dark, dark night. Yet perhaps I may be able once more\\r\\nto see the round red sun before he entirely disappears. I will climb up\\r\\nyonder rock.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he seized hold of the creeping-plants, and the roots of\\r\\ntrees--climbed up the moist stones where the water-snakes were writhing\\r\\nand the toads were croaking--and he gained the summit before the sun\\r\\nhad quite gone down. How magnificent was the sight from this height! The\\r\\nsea--the great, the glorious sea, that dashed its long waves against the\\r\\ncoast--was stretched out before him. And yonder, where sea and sky meet,\\r\\nstood the sun, like a large shining altar, all melted together in the\\r\\nmost glowing colors. And the wood and the sea sang a song of rejoicing,\\r\\nand his heart sang with the rest: all nature was a vast holy church,\\r\\nin which the trees and the buoyant clouds were the pillars, flowers and\\r\\ngrass the velvet carpeting, and heaven itself the large cupola. The red\\r\\ncolors above faded away as the sun vanished, but a million stars were\\r\\nlighted, a million lamps shone; and the King's Son spread out his arms\\r\\ntowards heaven, and wood, and sea; when at the same moment, coming by\\r\\na path to the right, appeared, in his wooden shoes and jacket, the poor\\r\\nboy who had been confirmed with him. He had followed his own path, and\\r\\nhad reached the spot just as soon as the son of the king had done. They\\r\\nran towards each other, and stood together hand in hand in the vast\\r\\nchurch of nature and of poetry, while over them sounded the invisible\\r\\nholy bell: blessed spirits floated around them, and lifted up their\\r\\nvoices in a rejoicing hallelujah!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OLD HOUSE\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the street, up there, was an old, a very old house--it was almost\\r\\nthree hundred years old, for that might be known by reading the great\\r\\nbeam on which the date of the year was carved: together with tulips and\\r\\nhop-binds there were whole verses spelled as in former times, and over\\r\\nevery window was a distorted face cut out in the beam. The one story\\r\\nstood forward a great way over the other; and directly under the eaves\\r\\nwas a leaden spout with a dragon's head; the rain-water should have run\\r\\nout of the mouth, but it ran out of the belly, for there was a hole in\\r\\nthe spout.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the other houses in the street were so new and so neat, with large\\r\\nwindow panes and smooth walls, one could easily see that they would have\\r\\nnothing to do with the old house: they certainly thought, “How long is\\r\\nthat old decayed thing to stand here as a spectacle in the street? And\\r\\nthen the projecting windows stand so far out, that no one can see from\\r\\nour windows what happens in that direction! The steps are as broad as\\r\\nthose of a palace, and as high as to a church tower. The iron railings\\r\\nlook just like the door to an old family vault, and then they have brass\\r\\ntops--that's so stupid!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side of the street were also new and neat houses, and they\\r\\nthought just as the others did; but at the window opposite the old house\\r\\nthere sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks and bright beaming eyes:\\r\\nhe certainly liked the old house best, and that both in sunshine and\\r\\nmoonshine. And when he looked across at the wall where the mortar\\r\\nhad fallen out, he could sit and find out there the strangest figures\\r\\nimaginable; exactly as the street had appeared before, with steps,\\r\\nprojecting windows, and pointed gables; he could see soldiers with\\r\\nhalberds, and spouts where the water ran, like dragons and serpents.\\r\\nThat was a house to look at; and there lived an old man, who wore plush\\r\\nbreeches; and he had a coat with large brass buttons, and a wig that one\\r\\ncould see was a real wig. Every morning there came an old fellow to him\\r\\nwho put his rooms in order, and went on errands; otherwise, the old man\\r\\nin the plush breeches was quite alone in the old house. Now and then he\\r\\ncame to the window and looked out, and the little boy nodded to him,\\r\\nand the old man nodded again, and so they became acquaintances, and then\\r\\nthey were friends, although they had never spoken to each other--but\\r\\nthat made no difference. The little boy heard his parents say, “The old\\r\\nman opposite is very well off, but he is so very, very lonely!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sunday following, the little boy took something, and wrapped it up\\r\\nin a piece of paper, went downstairs, and stood in the doorway; and when\\r\\nthe man who went on errands came past, he said to him--\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, master! will you give this to the old man over the way from me?\\r\\nI have two pewter soldiers--this is one of them, and he shall have it,\\r\\nfor I know he is so very, very lonely.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the old errand man looked quite pleased, nodded, and took the pewter\\r\\nsoldier over to the old house. Afterwards there came a message; it was\\r\\nto ask if the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a\\r\\nvisit; and so he got permission of his parents, and then went over to\\r\\nthe old house.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than ever;\\r\\none would have thought they were polished on account of the visit; and\\r\\nit was as if the carved-out trumpeters--for there were trumpeters, who\\r\\nstood in tulips, carved out on the door--blew with all their\\r\\nmight, their cheeks appeared so much rounder than before. Yes, they\\r\\nblew--“Trateratra! The little boy comes! Trateratra!”--and then the door\\r\\nopened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor, and\\r\\nladies in silken gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silken gowns\\r\\nrustled! And then there was a flight of stairs which went a good way\\r\\nupwards, and a little way downwards, and then one came on a balcony\\r\\nwhich was in a very dilapidated state, sure enough, with large holes and\\r\\nlong crevices, but grass grew there and leaves out of them altogether,\\r\\nfor the whole balcony outside, the yard, and the walls, were overgrown\\r\\nwith so much green stuff, that it looked like a garden; only a balcony.\\r\\nHere stood old flower-pots with faces and asses' ears, and the flowers\\r\\ngrew just as they liked. One of the pots was quite overrun on all sides\\r\\nwith pinks, that is to say, with the green part; shoot stood by shoot,\\r\\nand it said quite distinctly, “The air has cherished me, the sun has\\r\\nkissed me, and promised me a little flower on Sunday! a little flower on\\r\\nSunday!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog's\\r\\nleather, and printed with gold flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n   “The gilding decays,\\r\\n   But hog's leather stays!”\\r\\n\\r\\nsaid the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out,\\r\\nand with arms on both sides. “Sit down! sit down!” said they. “Ugh! how\\r\\nI creak; now I shall certainly get the gout, like the old clothespress,\\r\\nugh!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows\\r\\nwere, and where the old man sat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!” said the old\\r\\nman. “And I thank you because you come over to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thankee! thankee!” or “cranky! cranky!” sounded from all the furniture;\\r\\nthere was so much of it, that each article stood in the other's way, to\\r\\nget a look at the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady,\\r\\nso young, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes\\r\\nthat stood quite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said\\r\\n“thankee, thankee!” nor “cranky, cranky!” but looked with her mild eyes\\r\\nat the little boy, who directly asked the old man, “Where did you get\\r\\nher?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yonder, at the broker's,” said the old man, “where there are so many\\r\\npictures hanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of\\r\\nthem buried; but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead\\r\\nand gone these fifty years!”\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of withered\\r\\nflowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned,\\r\\nand everything in the room became still older; but they did not observe\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They say at home,” said the little boy, “that you are so very, very\\r\\nlonely!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” said he. “The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them,\\r\\ncome and visit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there were\\r\\nwhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters,\\r\\nwhich one never sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs,\\r\\nand citizens with waving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of\\r\\nshears held by two lions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots,\\r\\nbut with an eagle that had two heads, for the shoemakers must have\\r\\neverything so that they can say, it is a pair! Yes, that was a picture\\r\\nbook!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, and\\r\\nnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot bear it any longer!” said the pewter soldier, who sat on the\\r\\ndrawers. “It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in\\r\\na family circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear\\r\\nit any longer! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still\\r\\nlonger! Here it is not at all as it is over the way at your home, where\\r\\nyour father and mother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your\\r\\nsweet children made such a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man\\r\\nis--do you think that he gets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes,\\r\\nor a Christmas tree? He will get nothing but a grave! I can bear it no\\r\\nlonger!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must not let it grieve you so much,” said the little boy. “I find\\r\\nit so very delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what\\r\\nthey may bring with them, they come and visit here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know\\r\\nthem!” said the pewter soldier. “I cannot bear it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you must!” said the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the most\\r\\ndelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no\\r\\nmore about the pewter soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days\\r\\npassed away, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old\\r\\nhouse, and then the little boy went over there again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carved trumpeters blew, “Trateratra! There is the little boy!\\r\\nTrateratra!” and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled,\\r\\nand the silk gowns rustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs\\r\\nhad the gout in their legs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was\\r\\nexactly like the first time, for over there one day and hour was just\\r\\nlike another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot bear it!” said the pewter soldier. “I have shed pewter tears!\\r\\nIt is too melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and\\r\\nlegs! It would at least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I\\r\\nknow what it is to have a visit from one's old thoughts, with what they\\r\\nmay bring with them! I have had a visit from mine, and you may be sure\\r\\nit is no pleasant thing in the end; I was at last about to jump down\\r\\nfrom the drawers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were\\r\\nhere; it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before\\r\\nthe table and sung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood\\r\\ndevoutly with folded hands; and father and mother were just as pious;\\r\\nand then the door was opened, and little sister Mary, who is not two\\r\\nyears old yet, and who always dances when she hears music or singing, of\\r\\nwhatever kind it may be, was put into the room--though she ought not to\\r\\nhave been there--and then she began to dance, but could not keep time,\\r\\nbecause the tones were so long; and then she stood, first on the one\\r\\nleg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg, and bent\\r\\nher head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously all\\r\\ntogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and\\r\\nthen I fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it\\r\\nwas not right of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again\\r\\nin thought, and everything that I have lived to see; and these are the\\r\\nold thoughts, with what they may bring with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little\\r\\nMary! And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is\\r\\nhappy enough, that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are given away as a present!” said the little boy. “You must\\r\\nremain. Can you not understand that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen,\\r\\nboth “tin boxes” and “balsam boxes,” old cards, so large and so gilded,\\r\\nsuch as one never sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and\\r\\nthe piano was opened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it\\r\\nwas so hoarse when the old man played on it! and then he hummed a song.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, she could sing that!” said he, and nodded to the portrait, which\\r\\nhe had bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!” shouted the pewter\\r\\nsoldier as loud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right\\r\\ndown on the floor. What became of him? The old man sought, and the\\r\\nlittle boy sought; he was away, and he stayed away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall find him!” said the old man; but he never found him. The floor\\r\\nwas too open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there\\r\\nhe lay as in an open tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed,\\r\\nand several weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was\\r\\nobliged to sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old\\r\\nhouse, and there the snow had been blown into all the carved work and\\r\\ninscriptions; it lay quite up over the steps, just as if there was no\\r\\none at home--nor was there any one at home--the old man was dead!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne\\r\\ninto it in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in\\r\\nhis grave. He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends\\r\\nwere dead, and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was\\r\\ndriven away.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the\\r\\nlittle boy saw from his window how they carried the old knights and the\\r\\nold ladies away, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and\\r\\nthe old clothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there;\\r\\nthe portrait of her who had been found at the broker's came to the\\r\\nbroker's again; and there it hung, for no one knew her more--no one\\r\\ncared about the old picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was\\r\\na ruin. One could see from the street right into the room with the\\r\\nhog's-leather hanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass\\r\\nand leaves about the balcony hung quite wild about the falling beams.\\r\\nAnd then it was put to rights.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was a relief,” said the neighboring houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white\\r\\nwalls; but before it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a\\r\\nlittle garden laid out, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the\\r\\nneighboring house. Before the garden there was a large iron railing\\r\\nwith an iron door, it looked quite splendid, and people stood still and\\r\\npeeped in, and the sparrows hung by scores in the vine, and chattered\\r\\naway at each other as well as they could, but it was not about the old\\r\\nhouse, for they could not remember it, so many years had passed--so many\\r\\nthat the little boy had grown up to a whole man, yes, a clever man, and\\r\\na pleasure to his parents; and he had just been married, and, together\\r\\nwith his little wife, had come to live in the house here, where the\\r\\ngarden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted a field-flower\\r\\nthat she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand, and\\r\\npressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She\\r\\nhad stuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft\\r\\nmould.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at\\r\\nthe old man's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and\\r\\nthe rubbish, and had at last laid for many years in the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf,\\r\\nand then with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell,\\r\\nthat it was to the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a\\r\\ntrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me see him,” said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his\\r\\nhead. “Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter\\r\\nsoldier which I had when I was a little boy!” And then he told his wife\\r\\nabout the old house, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that\\r\\nhe sent over to him because he was so very, very lonely; and he told it\\r\\nas correctly as it had really been, so that the tears came into the eyes\\r\\nof his young wife, on account of the old house and the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!” said\\r\\nshe. “I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me;\\r\\nbut you must show me the old man's grave!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I do not know it,” said he, “and no one knows it! All his friends\\r\\nwere dead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How very, very lonely he must have been!” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very, very lonely!” said the pewter soldier. “But it is delightful not\\r\\nto be forgotten!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Delightful!” shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewter\\r\\nsoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had\\r\\nlost all its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an\\r\\nopinion, and it gave it:\\r\\n\\r\\n   “The gilding decays,\\r\\n   But hog's leather stays!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis the pewter soldier did not believe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HAPPY FAMILY\\r\\n\\r\\nReally, the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf; if one\\r\\nholds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it over\\r\\none's head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella, for\\r\\nit is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone, but where there\\r\\ngrows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and all this\\r\\ndelightfulness is snails' food. The great white snails which persons of\\r\\nquality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said, “Hem,\\r\\nhem! how delicious!” for they thought it tasted so delicate--lived on\\r\\ndock-leaves, and therefore burdock seeds were sown.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate snails, they\\r\\nwere quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct, they grew and\\r\\ngrew all over the walks and all the beds; they could not get the mastery\\r\\nover them--it was a whole forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an\\r\\napple and a plum-tree, or else one never would have thought that it was\\r\\na garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last venerable old\\r\\nsnails.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey themselves knew not how old they were, but they could remember\\r\\nvery well that there had been many more; that they were of a family\\r\\nfrom foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the whole forest was\\r\\nplanted. They had never been outside it, but they knew that there was\\r\\nstill something more in the world, which was called the manor-house, and\\r\\nthat there they were boiled, and then they became black, and were then\\r\\nplaced on a silver dish; but what happened further they knew not; or, in\\r\\nfact, what it was to be boiled, and to lie on a silver dish, they could\\r\\nnot possibly imagine; but it was said to be delightful, and particularly\\r\\ngenteel. Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the earth-worms, whom they\\r\\nasked about it could give them any information--none of them had been\\r\\nboiled or laid on a silver dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the\\r\\nworld, that they knew; the forest was planted for their sake, and the\\r\\nmanor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver\\r\\ndish.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow they lived a very lonely and happy life; and as they had no children\\r\\nthemselves, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought\\r\\nup as their own; but the little one would not grow, for he was of a\\r\\ncommon family; but the old ones, especially Dame Mother Snail, thought\\r\\nthey could observe how he increased in size, and she begged father,\\r\\nif he could not see it, that he would at least feel the little snail's\\r\\nshell; and then he felt it, and found the good dame was right.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day there was a heavy storm of rain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hear how it beats like a drum on the dock-leaves!” said Father Snail.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are also rain-drops!” said Mother Snail. “And now the rain pours\\r\\nright down the stalk! You will see that it will be wet here! I am very\\r\\nhappy to think that we have our good house, and the little one has\\r\\nhis also! There is more done for us than for all other creatures, sure\\r\\nenough; but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world?\\r\\nWe are provided with a house from our birth, and the burdock forest is\\r\\nplanted for our sakes! I should like to know how far it extends, and\\r\\nwhat there is outside!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is nothing at all,” said Father Snail. “No place can be better\\r\\nthan ours, and I have nothing to wish for!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said the dame. “I would willingly go to the manorhouse, be\\r\\nboiled, and laid on a silver dish; all our forefathers have been treated\\r\\nso; there is something extraordinary in it, you may be sure!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!” said Father Snail. “Or\\r\\nthe burdocks have grown up over it, so that they cannot come out. There\\r\\nneed not, however, be any haste about that; but you are always in such a\\r\\ntremendous hurry, and the little one is beginning to be the same. Has he\\r\\nnot been creeping up that stalk these three days? It gives me a headache\\r\\nwhen I look up to him!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must not scold him,” said Mother Snail. “He creeps so carefully; he\\r\\nwill afford us much pleasure--and we have nothing but him to live for!\\r\\nBut have you not thought of it? Where shall we get a wife for him? Do\\r\\nyou not think that there are some of our species at a great distance in\\r\\nthe interior of the burdock forest?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Black snails, I dare say, there are enough of,” said the old one.\\r\\n“Black snails without a house--but they are so common, and so conceited.\\r\\nBut we might give the ants a commission to look out for us; they run\\r\\nto and fro as if they had something to do, and they certainly know of a\\r\\nwife for our little snail!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know one, sure enough--the most charming one!” said one of the ants.\\r\\n“But I am afraid we shall hardly succeed, for she is a queen!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is nothing!” said the old folks. “Has she a house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She has a palace!” said the ant. “The finest ant's palace, with seven\\r\\nhundred passages!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thank you!” said Mother Snail. “Our son shall not go into an\\r\\nant-hill; if you know nothing better than that, we shall give the\\r\\ncommission to the white gnats. They fly far and wide, in rain and\\r\\nsunshine; they know the whole forest here, both within and without.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have a wife for him,” said the gnats. “At a hundred human paces from\\r\\nhere there sits a little snail in her house, on a gooseberry bush; she\\r\\nis quite lonely, and old enough to be married. It is only a hundred\\r\\nhuman paces!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, let her come to him!” said the old ones. “He has a whole\\r\\nforest of burdocks, she has only a bush!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they went and fetched little Miss Snail. It was a whole week\\r\\nbefore she arrived; but therein was just the very best of it, for one\\r\\ncould thus see that she was of the same species.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as\\r\\nthey could. In other respects the whole went off very quietly, for the\\r\\nold folks could not bear noise and merriment; but old Dame Snail made\\r\\na brilliant speech. Father Snail could not speak, he was too much\\r\\naffected; and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance, the whole\\r\\nforest of burdocks, and said--what they had always said--that it was\\r\\nthe best in the world; and if they lived honestly and decently, and\\r\\nincreased and multiplied, they and their children would once in the\\r\\ncourse of time come to the manor-house, be boiled black, and laid on\\r\\nsilver dishes. After this speech was made, the old ones crept into their\\r\\nshells, and never more came out. They slept; the young couple governed\\r\\nin the forest, and had a numerous progeny, but they were never boiled,\\r\\nand never came on the silver dishes; so from this they concluded that\\r\\nthe manor-house had fallen to ruins, and that all the men in the world\\r\\nwere extinct; and as no one contradicted them, so, of course it was so.\\r\\nAnd the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake,\\r\\nand the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their\\r\\nsakes; and they were very happy, and the whole family was happy; for\\r\\nthey, indeed were so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STORY OF A MOTHER\\r\\n\\r\\nA mother sat there with her little child. She was so downcast, so\\r\\nafraid that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed\\r\\nthemselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a\\r\\ndeep respiration, as if it sighed; and the mother looked still more\\r\\nsorrowfully on the little creature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man\\r\\nwrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he needed\\r\\nit, as it was the cold winter season! Everything out-of-doors was\\r\\ncovered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment,\\r\\nthe mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove,\\r\\nthat it might be warm for him; the old man sat and rocked the cradle,\\r\\nand the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her\\r\\nlittle sick child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you not think that I shall save him?” said she. “Our Lord will not\\r\\ntake him from me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the old man--it was Death himself--he nodded so strangely, it could\\r\\njust as well signify yes as no. And the mother looked down in her lap,\\r\\nand the tears ran down over her cheeks; her head became so heavy--she\\r\\nhad not closed her eyes for three days and nights; and now she slept,\\r\\nbut only for a minute, when she started up and trembled with cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is that?” said she, and looked on all sides; but the old man was\\r\\ngone, and her little child was gone--he had taken it with him; and the\\r\\nold clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden weight ran\\r\\ndown to the floor, bump! and then the clock also stood still.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black\\r\\nclothes; and she said, “Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him\\r\\nhasten away with thy little child; he goes faster than the wind, and he\\r\\nnever brings back what he takes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, only tell me which way he went!” said the mother. “Tell me the way,\\r\\nand I shall find him!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know it!” said the woman in the black clothes. “But before I tell it,\\r\\nthou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child!\\r\\nI am fond of them. I have heard them before; I am Night; I saw thy tears\\r\\nwhilst thou sang'st them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will sing them all, all!” said the mother. “But do not stop me now--I\\r\\nmay overtake him--I may find my child!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Night stood still and mute. Then the mother wrung her hands, sang\\r\\nand wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears; and then\\r\\nNight said, “Go to the right, into the dark pine forest; thither I saw\\r\\nDeath take his way with thy little child!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no\\r\\nlonger knew whither she should go! then there stood a thorn-bush;\\r\\nthere was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold winter\\r\\nseason, and ice-flakes hung on the branches.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?” said the\\r\\nmother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said the thorn-bush; “but I will not tell thee which way he took,\\r\\nunless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. I am freezing to death;\\r\\nI shall become a lump of ice!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it might\\r\\nbe thoroughly warmed, and the thorns went right into her flesh, and her\\r\\nblood flowed in large drops, but the thornbush shot forth fresh green\\r\\nleaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night, the heart\\r\\nof the afflicted mother was so warm; and the thorn-bush told her the way\\r\\nshe should go.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat.\\r\\nThe lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her; neither was it open,\\r\\nnor low enough that she could wade through it; and across it she must go\\r\\nif she would find her child! Then she lay down to drink up the lake, and\\r\\nthat was an impossibility for a human being, but the afflicted mother\\r\\nthought that a miracle might happen nevertheless.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!” said the weeping\\r\\nmother; and she wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths of\\r\\nthe waters, and became two precious pearls; but the water bore her up,\\r\\nas if she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore\\r\\non the opposite side, where there stood a mile-broad, strange house, one\\r\\nknew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were\\r\\nbuilt up; but the poor mother could not see it; she had wept her eyes\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has not come here yet!” said the old grave woman, who was appointed\\r\\nto look after Death's great greenhouse! “How have you been able to find\\r\\nthe way hither? And who has helped you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“OUR LORD has helped me,” said she. “He is merciful, and you will also\\r\\nbe so! Where shall I find my little child?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, I know not,” said the woman, “and you cannot see! Many flowers and\\r\\ntrees have withered this night; Death will soon come and plant them over\\r\\nagain! You certainly know that every person has his or her life's tree\\r\\nor flower, just as everyone happens to be settled; they look like other\\r\\nplants, but they have pulsations of the heart. Children's hearts can\\r\\nalso beat; go after yours, perhaps you may know your child's; but what\\r\\nwill you give me if I tell you what you shall do more?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have nothing to give,” said the afflicted mother, “but I will go to\\r\\nthe world's end for you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, I have nothing to do there!” said the woman. “But you can give\\r\\nme your long black hair; you know yourself that it is fine, and that\\r\\nI like! You shall have my white hair instead, and that's always\\r\\nsomething!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you demand nothing else?” said she. “That I will gladly give you!”\\r\\n And she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman's snow-white\\r\\nhair instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees\\r\\ngrew strangely into one another. There stood fine hyacinths under glass\\r\\nbells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water plants,\\r\\nsome so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them,\\r\\nand black crabs pinched their stalks. There stood beautiful palm-trees,\\r\\noaks, and plantains; there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree\\r\\nand every flower had its name; each of them was a human life, the human\\r\\nframe still lived--one in China, and another in Greenland--round about\\r\\nin the world. There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood\\r\\nso stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots; in other places,\\r\\nthere was a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it,\\r\\nand it was so petted and nursed. But the distressed mother bent down\\r\\nover all the smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart\\r\\nbeat; and amongst millions she knew her child's.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There it is!” cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little blue\\r\\ncrocus, that hung quite sickly on one side.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don't touch the flower!” said the old woman. “But place yourself here,\\r\\nand when Death comes--I expect him every moment--do not let him pluck\\r\\nthe flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the\\r\\nothers. Then he will be afraid! He is responsible for them to OUR LORD,\\r\\nand no one dares to pluck them up before HE gives leave.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall, and the blind\\r\\nmother could feel that it was Death that came.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?” he asked. “How couldst\\r\\nthou come quicker than I?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am a mother,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower,\\r\\nbut she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that\\r\\nshe should touch one of the leaves. Then Death blew on her hands, and\\r\\nshe felt that it was colder than the cold wind, and her hands fell down\\r\\npowerless.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thou canst not do anything against me!” said Death.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But OUR LORD can!” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I only do His bidding!” said Death. “I am His gardener, I take all His\\r\\nflowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of Paradise,\\r\\nin the unknown land; but how they grow there, and how it is there I dare\\r\\nnot tell thee.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me back my child!” said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At\\r\\nonce she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand,\\r\\nand cried out to Death, “I will tear all thy flowers off, for I am in\\r\\ndespair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Touch them not!” said Death. “Thou say'st that thou art so unhappy, and\\r\\nnow thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Another mother!” said the poor woman, and directly let go her hold of\\r\\nboth the flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, thou hast thine eyes,” said Death; “I fished them up from the\\r\\nlake, they shone so bright; I knew not they were thine. Take them again,\\r\\nthey are now brighter than before; now look down into the deep well\\r\\nclose by; I shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst\\r\\nhave torn up, and thou wilt see their whole future life--their whole\\r\\nhuman existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she looked down into the well; and it was a happiness to see how the\\r\\none became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and joy\\r\\nwere felt everywhere. And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow\\r\\nand distress, horror, and wretchedness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Both of them are God's will!” said Death.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which of them is Misfortune's flower and which is that of Happiness?”\\r\\n asked she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I will not tell thee,” said Death; “but this thou shalt know from\\r\\nme, that the one flower was thy own child! it was thy child's fate thou\\r\\nsaw'st--thy own child's future life!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the mother screamed with terror, “Which of them was my child? Tell\\r\\nit me! Save the innocent! Save my child from all that misery! Rather\\r\\ntake it away! Take it into God's kingdom! Forget my tears, forget my\\r\\nprayers, and all that I have done!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not understand thee!” said Death. “Wilt thou have thy child again,\\r\\nor shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to our\\r\\nLord: “Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is the best!\\r\\nhear me not! hear me not!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she bowed her head down in her lap, and Death took her child and\\r\\nwent with it into the unknown land.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FALSE COLLAR\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a fine gentleman, all of whose moveables were a boot-jack\\r\\nand a hair-comb: but he had the finest false collars in the world; and\\r\\nit is about one of these collars that we are now to hear a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was so old, that it began to think of marriage; and it happened that\\r\\nit came to be washed in company with a garter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay!” said the collar. “I never did see anything so slender and so\\r\\nfine, so soft and so neat. May I not ask your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I shall not tell you!” said the garter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where do you live?” asked the collar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the garter was so bashful, so modest, and thought it was a strange\\r\\nquestion to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are certainly a girdle,” said the collar; “that is to say an inside\\r\\ngirdle. I see well that you are both for use and ornament, my dear young\\r\\nlady.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will thank you not to speak to me,” said the garter. “I think I have\\r\\nnot given the least occasion for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes! When one is as handsome as you,” said the collar, “that is\\r\\noccasion enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don't come so near me, I beg of you!” said the garter. “You look so\\r\\nmuch like those men-folks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am also a fine gentleman,” said the collar. “I have a bootjack and a\\r\\nhair-comb.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that was not true, for it was his master who had them: but he\\r\\nboasted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don't come so near me,” said the garter: “I am not accustomed to it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Prude!” exclaimed the collar; and then it was taken out of the\\r\\nwashing-tub. It was starched, hung over the back of a chair in the\\r\\nsunshine, and was then laid on the ironing-blanket; then came the warm\\r\\nbox-iron. “Dear lady!” said the collar. “Dear widow-lady! I feel quite\\r\\nhot. I am quite changed. I begin to unfold myself. You will burn a hole\\r\\nin me. Oh! I offer you my hand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rag!” said the box-iron; and went proudly over the collar: for she\\r\\nfancied she was a steam-engine, that would go on the railroad and draw\\r\\nthe waggons. “Rag!” said the box-iron.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collar was a little jagged at the edge, and so came the long\\r\\nscissors to cut off the jagged part. “Oh!” said the collar. “You are\\r\\ncertainly the first opera dancer. How well you can stretch your legs\\r\\nout! It is the most graceful performance I have ever seen. No one can\\r\\nimitate you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know it,” said the scissors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You deserve to be a baroness,” said the collar. “All that I have is a\\r\\nfine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a hair-comb. If I only had the barony!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you seek my hand?” said the scissors; for she was angry; and without\\r\\nmore ado, she CUT HIM, and then he was condemned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall now be obliged to ask the hair-comb. It is surprising how well\\r\\nyou preserve your teeth, Miss,” said the collar. “Have you never thought\\r\\nof being betrothed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, of course! you may be sure of that,” said the hair-comb. “I AM\\r\\nbetrothed--to the boot-jack!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Betrothed!” exclaimed the collar. Now there was no other to court, and\\r\\nso he despised it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time passed away, then the collar came into the rag chest at the\\r\\npaper mill; there was a large company of rags, the fine by themselves,\\r\\nand the coarse by themselves, just as it should be. They all had much to\\r\\nsay, but the collar the most; for he was a real boaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have had such an immense number of sweethearts!” said the collar.\\r\\n“I could not be in peace! It is true, I was always a fine starched-up\\r\\ngentleman! I had both a boot-jack and a hair-comb, which I never used!\\r\\nYou should have seen me then, you should have seen me when I lay down!\\r\\nI shall never forget MY FIRST LOVE--she was a girdle, so fine, so soft,\\r\\nand so charming, she threw herself into a tub of water for my sake!\\r\\nThere was also a widow, who became glowing hot, but I left her standing\\r\\ntill she got black again; there was also the first opera dancer, she\\r\\ngave me that cut which I now go with, she was so ferocious! My\\r\\nown hair-comb was in love with me, she lost all her teeth from the\\r\\nheart-ache; yes, I have lived to see much of that sort of thing; but I\\r\\nam extremely sorry for the garter--I mean the girdle--that went into the\\r\\nwater-tub. I have much on my conscience, I want to become white paper!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it became so, all the rags were turned into white paper; but the\\r\\ncollar came to be just this very piece of white paper we here see,\\r\\nand on which the story is printed; and that was because it boasted so\\r\\nterribly afterwards of what had never happened to it. It would be well\\r\\nfor us to beware, that we may not act in a similar manner, for we can\\r\\nnever know if we may not, in the course of time, also come into the\\r\\nrag chest, and be made into white paper, and then have our whole life's\\r\\nhistory printed on it, even the most secret, and be obliged to run about\\r\\nand tell it ourselves, just like this collar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SHADOW\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in the hot lands that the sun burns, sure enough! there the people\\r\\nbecome quite a mahogany brown, ay, and in the HOTTEST lands they are\\r\\nburnt to Negroes. But now it was only to the HOT lands that a learned\\r\\nman had come from the cold; there he thought that he could run about\\r\\njust as when at home, but he soon found out his mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, and all sensible folks, were obliged to stay within doors--the\\r\\nwindow-shutters and doors were closed the whole day; it looked as if the\\r\\nwhole house slept, or there was no one at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrow street with the high houses, was built so that the sunshine\\r\\nmust fall there from morning till evening--it was really not to be\\r\\nborne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe learned man from the cold lands--he was a young man, and seemed to\\r\\nbe a clever man--sat in a glowing oven; it took effect on him, he became\\r\\nquite meagre--even his shadow shrunk in, for the sun had also an effect\\r\\non it. It was first towards evening when the sun was down, that they\\r\\nbegan to freshen up again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the warm lands every window has a balcony, and the people came out on\\r\\nall the balconies in the street--for one must have air, even if one be\\r\\naccustomed to be mahogany!* It was lively both up and down the\\r\\nstreet. Tailors, and shoemakers, and all the folks, moved out into the\\r\\nstreet--chairs and tables were brought forth--and candles burnt--yes,\\r\\nabove a thousand lights were burning--and the one talked and the other\\r\\nsung; and people walked and church-bells rang, and asses went along with\\r\\na dingle-dingle-dong! for they too had bells on. The street boys were\\r\\nscreaming and hooting, and shouting and shooting, with devils and\\r\\ndetonating balls--and there came corpse bearers and hood wearers--for\\r\\nthere were funerals with psalm and hymn--and then the din of carriages\\r\\ndriving and company arriving: yes, it was, in truth, lively enough down\\r\\nin the street. Only in that single house, which stood opposite that in\\r\\nwhich the learned foreigner lived, it was quite still; and yet some one\\r\\nlived there, for there stood flowers in the balcony--they grew so\\r\\nwell in the sun's heat! and that they could not do unless they were\\r\\nwatered--and some one must water them--there must be somebody there.\\r\\nThe door opposite was also opened late in the evening, but it was dark\\r\\nwithin, at least in the front room; further in there was heard the sound\\r\\nof music. The learned foreigner thought it quite marvellous, but now--it\\r\\nmight be that he only imagined it--for he found everything marvellous\\r\\nout there, in the warm lands, if there had only been no sun. The\\r\\nstranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the house\\r\\nopposite, one saw no person about, and as to the music, it appeared\\r\\nto him to be extremely tiresome. “It is as if some one sat there, and\\r\\npractised a piece that he could not master--always the same piece. 'I\\r\\nshall master it!' says he; but yet he cannot master it, however long he\\r\\nplays.”\\r\\n\\r\\n* The word mahogany can be understood, in Danish, as having two\\r\\nmeanings. In general, it means the reddish-brown wood itself; but in\\r\\njest, it signifies “excessively fine,” which arose from an anecdote of\\r\\nNyboder, in Copenhagen, (the seamen's quarter.) A sailor's wife, who was\\r\\nalways proud and fine, in her way, came to her neighbor, and complained\\r\\nthat she had got a splinter in her finger. “What of?” asked the\\r\\nneighbor's wife. “It is a mahogany splinter,” said the other. “Mahogany!\\r\\nIt cannot be less with you!” exclaimed the woman--and thence the\\r\\nproverb, “It is so mahogany!”--(that is, so excessively fine)--is\\r\\nderived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night the stranger awoke--he slept with the doors of the balcony\\r\\nopen--the curtain before it was raised by the wind, and he thought\\r\\nthat a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house; all the\\r\\nflowers shone like flames, in the most beautiful colors, and in the\\r\\nmidst of the flowers stood a slender, graceful maiden--it was as if she\\r\\nalso shone; the light really hurt his eyes. He now opened them quite\\r\\nwide--yes, he was quite awake; with one spring he was on the floor; he\\r\\ncrept gently behind the curtain, but the maiden was gone; the flowers\\r\\nshone no longer, but there they stood, fresh and blooming as ever;\\r\\nthe door was ajar, and, far within, the music sounded so soft and\\r\\ndelightful, one could really melt away in sweet thoughts from it. Yet\\r\\nit was like a piece of enchantment. And who lived there? Where was the\\r\\nactual entrance? The whole of the ground-floor was a row of shops, and\\r\\nthere people could not always be running through.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening the stranger sat out on the balcony. The light burnt in the\\r\\nroom behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should\\r\\nfall on his opposite neighbor's wall. Yes! there it sat, directly\\r\\nopposite, between the flowers on the balcony; and when the stranger\\r\\nmoved, the shadow also moved: for that it always does.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there,” said\\r\\nthe learned man. “See, how nicely it sits between the flowers. The door\\r\\nstands half-open: now the shadow should be cunning, and go into the\\r\\nroom, look about, and then come and tell me what it had seen. Come, now!\\r\\nBe useful, and do me a service,” said he, in jest. “Have the kindness to\\r\\nstep in. Now! Art thou going?” and then he nodded to the shadow, and the\\r\\nshadow nodded again. “Well then, go! But don't stay away.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger rose, and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony\\r\\nrose also; the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned round.\\r\\nYes! if anyone had paid particular attention to it, they would have\\r\\nseen, quite distinctly, that the shadow went in through the half-open\\r\\nbalcony-door of their opposite neighbor, just as the stranger went into\\r\\nhis own room, and let the long curtain fall down after him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, the learned man went out to drink coffee and read the\\r\\nnewspapers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is that?” said he, as he came out into the sunshine. “I have no\\r\\nshadow! So then, it has actually gone last night, and not come again. It\\r\\nis really tiresome!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone, but because\\r\\nhe knew there was a story about a man without a shadow.* It was known\\r\\nto everybody at home, in the cold lands; and if the learned man now came\\r\\nthere and told his story, they would say that he was imitating it, and\\r\\nthat he had no need to do. He would, therefore, not talk about it at\\r\\nall; and that was wisely thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Peter Schlemihl, the shadowless man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening he went out again on the balcony. He had placed the light\\r\\ndirectly behind him, for he knew that the shadow would always have its\\r\\nmaster for a screen, but he could not entice it. He made himself little;\\r\\nhe made himself great: but no shadow came again. He said, “Hem! hem!”\\r\\n but it was of no use.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was vexatious; but in the warm lands everything grows so quickly; and\\r\\nafter the lapse of eight days he observed, to his great joy, that a new\\r\\nshadow came in the sunshine. In the course of three weeks he had a very\\r\\nfair shadow, which, when he set out for his home in the northern lands,\\r\\ngrew more and more in the journey, so that at last it was so long and so\\r\\nlarge, that it was more than sufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe learned man then came home, and he wrote books about what was true\\r\\nin the world, and about what was good and what was beautiful; and there\\r\\npassed days and years--yes! many years passed away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, as he was sitting in his room, there was a gentle knocking\\r\\nat the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come in!” said he; but no one came in; so he opened the door, and there\\r\\nstood before him such an extremely lean man, that he felt quite strange.\\r\\nAs to the rest, the man was very finely dressed--he must be a gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whom have I the honor of speaking?” asked the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes! I thought as much,” said the fine man. “I thought you would not\\r\\nknow me. I have got so much body. I have even got flesh and clothes. You\\r\\ncertainly never thought of seeing me so well off. Do you not know your\\r\\nold shadow? You certainly thought I should never more return. Things\\r\\nhave gone on well with me since I was last with you. I have, in all\\r\\nrespects, become very well off. Shall I purchase my freedom from\\r\\nservice? If so, I can do it”; and then he rattled a whole bunch of\\r\\nvaluable seals that hung to his watch, and he stuck his hand in the\\r\\nthick gold chain he wore around his neck--nay! how all his fingers\\r\\nglittered with diamond rings; and then all were pure gems.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay; I cannot recover from my surprise!” said the learned man. “What is\\r\\nthe meaning of all this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Something common, is it not,” said the shadow. “But you yourself do not\\r\\nbelong to the common order; and I, as you know well, have from a child\\r\\nfollowed in your footsteps. As soon as you found I was capable to go\\r\\nout alone in the world, I went my own way. I am in the most brilliant\\r\\ncircumstances, but there came a sort of desire over me to see you once\\r\\nmore before you die; you will die, I suppose? I also wished to see this\\r\\nland again--for you know we always love our native land. I know you have\\r\\ngot another shadow again; have I anything to pay to it or you? If so,\\r\\nyou will oblige me by saying what it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, is it really thou?” said the learned man. “It is most remarkable:\\r\\nI never imagined that one's old shadow could come again as a man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me what I have to pay,” said the shadow; “for I don't like to be\\r\\nin any sort of debt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How canst thou talk so?” said the learned man. “What debt is there to\\r\\ntalk about? Make thyself as free as anyone else. I am extremely glad to\\r\\nhear of thy good fortune: sit down, old friend, and tell me a little\\r\\nhow it has gone with thee, and what thou hast seen at our opposite\\r\\nneighbor's there--in the warm lands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I will tell you all about it,” said the shadow, and sat down: “but\\r\\nthen you must also promise me, that, wherever you may meet me, you will\\r\\nnever say to anyone here in the town that I have been your shadow. I\\r\\nintend to get betrothed, for I can provide for more than one family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be quite at thy ease about that,” said the learned man; “I shall not\\r\\nsay to anyone who thou actually art: here is my hand--I promise it, and\\r\\na man's bond is his word.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A word is a shadow,” said the shadow, “and as such it must speak.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was really quite astonishing how much of a man it was. It was dressed\\r\\nentirely in black, and of the very finest cloth; it had patent leather\\r\\nboots, and a hat that could be folded together, so that it was bare\\r\\ncrown and brim; not to speak of what we already know it had--seals, gold\\r\\nneck-chain, and diamond rings; yes, the shadow was well-dressed, and it\\r\\nwas just that which made it quite a man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now I shall tell you my adventures,” said the shadow; and then he\\r\\nsat, with the polished boots, as heavily as he could, on the arm of the\\r\\nlearned man's new shadow, which lay like a poodle-dog at his feet.\\r\\nNow this was perhaps from arrogance; and the shadow on the ground kept\\r\\nitself so still and quiet, that it might hear all that passed: it wished\\r\\nto know how it could get free, and work its way up, so as to become its\\r\\nown master.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know who lived in our opposite neighbor's house?” said the\\r\\nshadow. “It was the most charming of all beings, it was Poesy! I was\\r\\nthere for three weeks, and that has as much effect as if one had lived\\r\\nthree thousand years, and read all that was composed and written;\\r\\nthat is what I say, and it is right. I have seen everything and I know\\r\\neverything!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poesy!” cried the learned man. “Yes, yes, she often dwells a recluse\\r\\nin large cities! Poesy! Yes, I have seen her--a single short moment,\\r\\nbut sleep came into my eyes! She stood on the balcony and shone as the\\r\\nAurora Borealis shines. Go on, go on--thou wert on the balcony, and went\\r\\nthrough the doorway, and then--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I was in the antechamber,” said the shadow. “You always sat and\\r\\nlooked over to the antechamber. There was no light; there was a sort\\r\\nof twilight, but the one door stood open directly opposite the other\\r\\nthrough a long row of rooms and saloons, and there it was lighted up. I\\r\\nshould have been completely killed if I had gone over to the maiden; but\\r\\nI was circumspect, I took time to think, and that one must always do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what didst thou then see?” asked the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw everything, and I shall tell all to you: but--it is no pride on\\r\\nmy part--as a free man, and with the knowledge I have, not to speak of\\r\\nmy position in life, my excellent circumstances--I certainly wish that\\r\\nyou would say YOU* to me!”\\r\\n\\r\\n* It is the custom in Denmark for intimate acquaintances to use the\\r\\nsecond person singular, “Du,” (thou) when speaking to each other. When\\r\\na friendship is formed between men, they generally affirm it, when\\r\\noccasion offers, either in public or private, by drinking to each other\\r\\nand exclaiming, “thy health,” at the same time striking their glasses\\r\\ntogether. This is called drinking “Duus”: they are then, “Duus Brodre,”\\r\\n (thou brothers) and ever afterwards use the pronoun “thou,” to each\\r\\nother, it being regarded as more familiar than “De,” (you). Father and\\r\\nmother, sister and brother say thou to one another--without regard to\\r\\nage or rank. Master and mistress say thou to their servants the superior\\r\\nto the inferior. But servants and inferiors do not use the same term\\r\\nto their masters, or superiors--nor is it ever used when speaking to a\\r\\nstranger, or anyone with whom they are but slightly acquainted--they\\r\\nthen say as in English--you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg your pardon,” said the learned man; “it is an old habit with me.\\r\\nYOU are perfectly right, and I shall remember it; but now you must tell\\r\\nme all YOU saw!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everything!” said the shadow. “For I saw everything, and I know\\r\\neverything!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did it look in the furthest saloon?” asked the learned man. “Was it\\r\\nthere as in the fresh woods? Was it there as in a holy church? Were the\\r\\nsaloons like the starlit firmament when we stand on the high mountains?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everything was there!” said the shadow. “I did not go quite in, I\\r\\nremained in the foremost room, in the twilight, but I stood there\\r\\nquite well; I saw everything, and I know everything! I have been in the\\r\\nantechamber at the court of Poesy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But WHAT DID you see? Did all the gods of the olden times pass through\\r\\nthe large saloons? Did the old heroes combat there? Did sweet children\\r\\nplay there, and relate their dreams?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you I was there, and you can conceive that I saw everything\\r\\nthere was to be seen. Had you come over there, you would not have been\\r\\na man; but I became so! And besides, I learned to know my inward nature,\\r\\nmy innate qualities, the relationship I had with Poesy. At the time I\\r\\nwas with you, I thought not of that, but always--you know it well--when\\r\\nthe sun rose, and when the sun went down, I became so strangely great;\\r\\nin the moonlight I was very near being more distinct than yourself; at\\r\\nthat time I did not understand my nature; it was revealed to me in the\\r\\nantechamber! I became a man! I came out matured; but you were no longer\\r\\nin the warm lands; as a man I was ashamed to go as I did. I was in\\r\\nwant of boots, of clothes, of the whole human varnish that makes a man\\r\\nperceptible. I took my way--I tell it to you, but you will not put it in\\r\\nany book--I took my way to the cake woman--I hid myself behind her;\\r\\nthe woman didn't think how much she concealed. I went out first in the\\r\\nevening; I ran about the streets in the moonlight; I made myself long up\\r\\nthe walls--it tickles the back so delightfully! I ran up, and ran down,\\r\\npeeped into the highest windows, into the saloons, and on the roofs, I\\r\\npeeped in where no one could peep, and I saw what no one else saw, what\\r\\nno one else should see! This is, in fact, a base world! I would not be a\\r\\nman if it were not now once accepted and regarded as something to be so!\\r\\nI saw the most unimaginable things with the women, with the men, with\\r\\nparents, and with the sweet, matchless children; I saw,” said the\\r\\nshadow, “what no human being must know, but what they would all\\r\\nso willingly know--what is bad in their neighbor. Had I written a\\r\\nnewspaper, it would have been read! But I wrote direct to the persons\\r\\nthemselves, and there was consternation in all the towns where I came.\\r\\nThey were so afraid of me, and yet they were so excessively fond of\\r\\nme. The professors made a professor of me; the tailors gave me new\\r\\nclothes--I am well furnished; the master of the mint struck new coin for\\r\\nme, and the women said I was so handsome! And so I became the man I am.\\r\\nAnd I now bid you farewell. Here is my card--I live on the sunny side\\r\\nof the street, and am always at home in rainy weather!” And so away went\\r\\nthe shadow. “That was most extraordinary!” said the learned man. Years\\r\\nand days passed away, then the shadow came again. “How goes it?” said\\r\\nthe shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alas!” said the learned man. “I write about the true, and the good,\\r\\nand the beautiful, but no one cares to hear such things; I am quite\\r\\ndesperate, for I take it so much to heart!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I don't!” said the shadow. “I become fat, and it is that one wants\\r\\nto become! You do not understand the world. You will become ill by it.\\r\\nYou must travel! I shall make a tour this summer; will you go with me?\\r\\nI should like to have a travelling companion! Will you go with me, as\\r\\nshadow? It will be a great pleasure for me to have you with me; I shall\\r\\npay the travelling expenses!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, this is too much!” said the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is just as one takes it!” said the shadow. “It will do you much good\\r\\nto travel! Will you be my shadow? You shall have everything free on the\\r\\njourney!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, that is too bad!” said the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it is just so with the world!” said the shadow, “and so it will\\r\\nbe!” and away it went again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe learned man was not at all in the most enviable state; grief and\\r\\ntorment followed him, and what he said about the true, and the good, and\\r\\nthe beautiful, was, to most persons, like roses for a cow! He was quite\\r\\nill at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You really look like a shadow!” said his friends to him; and the\\r\\nlearned man trembled, for he thought of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must go to a watering-place!” said the shadow, who came and visited\\r\\nhim. “There is nothing else for it! I will take you with me for old\\r\\nacquaintance' sake; I will pay the travelling expenses, and you write\\r\\nthe descriptions--and if they are a little amusing for me on the way!\\r\\nI will go to a watering-place--my beard does not grow out as it\\r\\nought--that is also a sickness--and one must have a beard! Now you be\\r\\nwise and accept the offer; we shall travel as comrades!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they travelled; the shadow was master, and the master was the\\r\\nshadow; they drove with each other, they rode and walked together, side\\r\\nby side, before and behind, just as the sun was; the shadow always took\\r\\ncare to keep itself in the master's place. Now the learned man didn't\\r\\nthink much about that; he was a very kind-hearted man, and particularly\\r\\nmild and friendly, and so he said one day to the shadow: “As we have\\r\\nnow become companions, and in this way have grown up together from\\r\\nchildhood, shall we not drink 'thou' together, it is more familiar?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are right,” said the shadow, who was now the proper master. “It is\\r\\nsaid in a very straight-forward and well-meant manner. You, as a learned\\r\\nman, certainly know how strange nature is. Some persons cannot bear to\\r\\ntouch grey paper, or they become ill; others shiver in every limb if one\\r\\nrub a pane of glass with a nail: I have just such a feeling on hearing\\r\\nyou say thou to me; I feel myself as if pressed to the earth in my first\\r\\nsituation with you. You see that it is a feeling; that it is not pride:\\r\\nI cannot allow you to say THOU to me, but I will willingly say THOU to\\r\\nyou, so it is half done!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the shadow said THOU to its former master.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is rather too bad,” thought he, “that I must say YOU and he say\\r\\nTHOU,” but he was now obliged to put up with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they came to a watering-place where there were many strangers, and\\r\\namongst them was a princess, who was troubled with seeing too well; and\\r\\nthat was so alarming!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe directly observed that the stranger who had just come was quite a\\r\\ndifferent sort of person to all the others; “He has come here in order\\r\\nto get his beard to grow, they say, but I see the real cause, he cannot\\r\\ncast a shadow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had become inquisitive; and so she entered into conversation\\r\\ndirectly with the strange gentleman, on their promenades. As the\\r\\ndaughter of a king, she needed not to stand upon trifles, so she said,\\r\\n“Your complaint is, that you cannot cast a shadow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your Royal Highness must be improving considerably,” said the shadow,\\r\\n“I know your complaint is, that you see too clearly, but it has\\r\\ndecreased, you are cured. I just happen to have a very unusual shadow!\\r\\nDo you not see that person who always goes with me? Other persons have\\r\\na common shadow, but I do not like what is common to all. We give our\\r\\nservants finer cloth for their livery than we ourselves use, and so I\\r\\nhad my shadow trimmed up into a man: yes, you see I have even given him\\r\\na shadow. It is somewhat expensive, but I like to have something for\\r\\nmyself!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What!” thought the princess. “Should I really be cured! These baths are\\r\\nthe first in the world! In our time water has wonderful powers. But I\\r\\nshall not leave the place, for it now begins to be amusing here. I am\\r\\nextremely fond of that stranger: would that his beard should not grow,\\r\\nfor in that case he will leave us!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, the princess and the shadow danced together in the large\\r\\nball-room. She was light, but he was still lighter; she had never had\\r\\nsuch a partner in the dance. She told him from what land she came, and\\r\\nhe knew that land; he had been there, but then she was not at home; he\\r\\nhad peeped in at the window, above and below--he had seen both the\\r\\none and the other, and so he could answer the princess, and make\\r\\ninsinuations, so that she was quite astonished; he must be the wisest\\r\\nman in the whole world! She felt such respect for what he knew! So that\\r\\nwhen they again danced together she fell in love with him; and that the\\r\\nshadow could remark, for she almost pierced him through with her eyes.\\r\\nSo they danced once more together; and she was about to declare herself,\\r\\nbut she was discreet; she thought of her country and kingdom, and of the\\r\\nmany persons she would have to reign over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is a wise man,” said she to herself--“It is well; and he dances\\r\\ndelightfully--that is also good; but has he solid knowledge? That is\\r\\njust as important! He must be examined.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she began, by degrees, to question him about the most difficult\\r\\nthings she could think of, and which she herself could not have\\r\\nanswered; so that the shadow made a strange face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You cannot answer these questions?” said the princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They belong to my childhood's learning,” said the shadow. “I really\\r\\nbelieve my shadow, by the door there, can answer them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your shadow!” said the princess. “That would indeed be marvellous!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not say for a certainty that he can,” said the shadow, “but I\\r\\nthink so; he has now followed me for so many years, and listened to my\\r\\nconversation--I should think it possible. But your royal highness will\\r\\npermit me to observe, that he is so proud of passing himself off for\\r\\na man, that when he is to be in a proper humor--and he must be so to\\r\\nanswer well--he must be treated quite like a man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! I like that!” said the princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she went to the learned man by the door, and she spoke to him about\\r\\nthe sun and the moon, and about persons out of and in the world, and he\\r\\nanswered with wisdom and prudence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a man that must be who has so wise a shadow!” thought she. “It\\r\\nwill be a real blessing to my people and kingdom if I choose him for my\\r\\nconsort--I will do it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were soon agreed, both the princess and the shadow; but no one was\\r\\nto know about it before she arrived in her own kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one--not even my shadow!” said the shadow, and he had his own\\r\\nthoughts about it!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow they were in the country where the princess reigned when she was at\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, my good friend,” said the shadow to the learned man. “I have\\r\\nnow become as happy and mighty as anyone can be; I will, therefore, do\\r\\nsomething particular for thee! Thou shalt always live with me in the\\r\\npalace, drive with me in my royal carriage, and have ten thousand\\r\\npounds a year; but then thou must submit to be called SHADOW by all and\\r\\neveryone; thou must not say that thou hast ever been a man; and once\\r\\na year, when I sit on the balcony in the sunshine, thou must lie at my\\r\\nfeet, as a shadow shall do! I must tell thee: I am going to marry the\\r\\nking's daughter, and the nuptials are to take place this evening!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, this is going too far!” said the learned man. “I will not have it;\\r\\nI will not do it! It is to deceive the whole country and the princess\\r\\ntoo! I will tell everything! That I am a man, and that thou art a\\r\\nshadow--thou art only dressed up!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no one who will believe it!” said the shadow. “Be reasonable,\\r\\nor I will call the guard!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will go directly to the princess!” said the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I will go first!” said the shadow. “And thou wilt go to prison!”\\r\\n and that he was obliged to do--for the sentinels obeyed him whom they\\r\\nknew the king's daughter was to marry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You tremble!” said the princess, as the shadow came into her chamber.\\r\\n“Has anything happened? You must not be unwell this evening, now that we\\r\\nare to have our nuptials celebrated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have lived to see the most cruel thing that anyone can live to\\r\\nsee!” said the shadow. “Only imagine--yes, it is true, such a poor\\r\\nshadow-skull cannot bear much--only think, my shadow has become mad;\\r\\nhe thinks that he is a man, and that I--now only think--that I am his\\r\\nshadow!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is terrible!” said the princess; “but he is confined, is he not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That he is. I am afraid that he will never recover.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor shadow!” said the princess. “He is very unfortunate; it would be\\r\\na real work of charity to deliver him from the little life he has, and,\\r\\nwhen I think properly over the matter, I am of opinion that it will be\\r\\nnecessary to do away with him in all stillness!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is certainly hard,” said the shadow, “for he was a faithful\\r\\nservant!” and then he gave a sort of sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a noble character!” said the princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole city was illuminated in the evening, and the cannons went off\\r\\nwith a bum! bum! and the soldiers presented arms. That was a marriage!\\r\\nThe princess and the shadow went out on the balcony to show themselves,\\r\\nand get another hurrah!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe learned man heard nothing of all this--for they had deprived him of\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE MATCH GIRL\\r\\n\\r\\nMost terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and\\r\\nevening--the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there\\r\\nwent along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked\\r\\nfeet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was\\r\\nthe good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had\\r\\nhitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them\\r\\nas she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that\\r\\nrolled by dreadfully fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by\\r\\nan urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for\\r\\na cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the\\r\\nlittle maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red\\r\\nand blue from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron,\\r\\nand she held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of\\r\\nher the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of\\r\\nsorrow, the poor little thing!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful\\r\\ncurls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now\\r\\nthought. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so\\r\\ndeliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of\\r\\nthat she thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the\\r\\nother, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet\\r\\nshe had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go\\r\\nhome she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could\\r\\nnot bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get\\r\\nblows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof,\\r\\nthrough which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were\\r\\nstopped up with straw and rags.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford\\r\\nher a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the\\r\\nbundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew\\r\\none out. “Rischt!” how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright\\r\\nflame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful\\r\\nlight. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting\\r\\nbefore a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass\\r\\nornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed\\r\\nso delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to\\r\\nwarm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she\\r\\nhad only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the\\r\\nlight fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a\\r\\nveil, so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a\\r\\nsnow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the\\r\\nroast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried\\r\\nplums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped\\r\\ndown from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its\\r\\nbreast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went\\r\\nout and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind.\\r\\nShe lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the most\\r\\nmagnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than\\r\\nthe one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and\\r\\ngaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked\\r\\ndown upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them\\r\\nwhen--the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher\\r\\nand higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and\\r\\nformed a long trail of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Someone is just dead!” said the little girl; for her old grandmother,\\r\\nthe only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told\\r\\nher, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the\\r\\nlustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild,\\r\\nand with such an expression of love.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Grandmother!” cried the little one. “Oh, take me with you! You go\\r\\naway when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the\\r\\ndelicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!” And\\r\\nshe rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for\\r\\nshe wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And\\r\\nthe matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at\\r\\nnoon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and\\r\\nso tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in\\r\\nbrightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was neither\\r\\ncold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with\\r\\nrosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen\\r\\nto death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the\\r\\nchild there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. “She\\r\\nwanted to warm herself,” people said. No one had the slightest suspicion\\r\\nof what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the\\r\\nsplendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a\\r\\nnew year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DREAM OF LITTLE TUK\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! yes, that was little Tuk: in reality his name was not Tuk, but that\\r\\nwas what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for\\r\\nCharles, and it is all well enough if one does but know it. He had now\\r\\nto take care of his little sister Augusta, who was much younger than\\r\\nhimself, and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same time; but\\r\\nthese two things would not do together at all. There sat the poor little\\r\\nfellow, with his sister on his lap, and he sang to her all the songs he\\r\\nknew; and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book\\r\\nthat lay open before him. By the next morning he was to have learnt\\r\\nall the towns in Zealand by heart, and to know about them all that is\\r\\npossible to be known.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mother now came home, for she had been out, and took little Augusta\\r\\non her arm. Tuk ran quickly to the window, and read so eagerly that he\\r\\npretty nearly read his eyes out; for it got darker and darker, but his\\r\\nmother had no money to buy a candle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There goes the old washerwoman over the way,” said his mother, as she\\r\\nlooked out of the window. “The poor woman can hardly drag herself along,\\r\\nand she must now drag the pail home from the fountain. Be a good boy,\\r\\nTukey, and run across and help the old woman, won't you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Tuk ran over quickly and helped her; but when he came back again into\\r\\nthe room it was quite dark, and as to a light, there was no thought of\\r\\nsuch a thing. He was now to go to bed; that was an old turn-up bedstead;\\r\\nin it he lay and thought about his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and\\r\\nof all that his master had told him. He ought, to be sure, to have read\\r\\nover his lesson again, but that, you know, he could not do. He therefore\\r\\nput his geography-book under his pillow, because he had heard that was\\r\\na very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson; but one\\r\\ncannot, however, rely upon it entirely. Well, there he lay, and thought\\r\\nand thought, and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes\\r\\nand mouth: he slept, and yet he did not sleep; it was as though the old\\r\\nwasherwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said, “It were a great\\r\\nsin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning. You have aided\\r\\nme, I therefore will now help you; and the loving God will do so at all\\r\\ntimes.” And all of a sudden the book under Tuk's pillow began scraping\\r\\nand scratching.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kickery-ki! kluk! kluk! kluk!”--that was an old hen who came creeping\\r\\nalong, and she was from Kjoge. “I am a Kjoger hen,” [*] said she, and then\\r\\nshe related how many inhabitants there were there, and about the battle\\r\\nthat had taken place, and which, after all, was hardly worth talking\\r\\nabout.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * Kjoge, a town in the bay of Kjoge. “To see the Kjoge\\r\\n     hens,” is an expression similar to “showing a child London,”\\r\\n      which is said to be done by taking his head in both bands,\\r\\n     and so lifting him off the ground. At the invasion of the\\r\\n     English in 1807, an encounter of a no very glorious nature\\r\\n     took place between the British troops and the undisciplined\\r\\n     Danish militia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kribledy, krabledy--plump!” down fell somebody: it was a wooden bird,\\r\\nthe popinjay used at the shooting-matches at Prastoe. Now he said that\\r\\nthere were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body; and he\\r\\nwas very proud. “Thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me.* Plump! Here\\r\\nI lie capitally.”\\r\\n\\r\\n* Prastoe, a still smaller town than Kjoge. Some hundred paces from\\r\\nit lies the manor-house Ny Soe, where Thorwaldsen, the famed sculptor,\\r\\ngenerally sojourned during his stay in Denmark, and where he called many\\r\\nof his immortal works into existence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut little Tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on\\r\\nhorseback. On he went at full gallop, still galloping on and on. A\\r\\nknight with a gleaming plume, and most magnificently dressed, held him\\r\\nbefore him on the horse, and thus they rode through the wood to the old\\r\\ntown of Bordingborg, and that was a large and very lively town. High\\r\\ntowers rose from the castle of the king, and the brightness of many\\r\\ncandles streamed from all the windows; within was dance and song,\\r\\nand King Waldemar and the young, richly-attired maids of honor danced\\r\\ntogether. The morn now came; and as soon as the sun appeared, the whole\\r\\ntown and the king's palace crumbled together, and one tower after the\\r\\nother; and at last only a single one remained standing where the castle\\r\\nhad been before,* and the town was so small and poor, and the school\\r\\nboys came along with their books under their arms, and said, “2000\\r\\ninhabitants!” but that was not true, for there were not so many.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Bordingborg, in the reign of King Waldemar, a considerable place, now\\r\\nan unimportant little town. One solitary tower only, and some remains of\\r\\na wall, show where the castle once stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd little Tukey lay in his bed: it seemed to him as if he dreamed, and\\r\\nyet as if he were not dreaming; however, somebody was close beside him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Little Tukey! Little Tukey!” cried someone near. It was a seaman,\\r\\nquite a little personage, so little as if he were a midshipman; but a\\r\\nmidshipman it was not.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Many remembrances from Corsor.* That is a town that is just rising\\r\\ninto importance; a lively town that has steam-boats and stagecoaches:\\r\\nformerly people called it ugly, but that is no longer true. I lie on\\r\\nthe sea,” said Corsor; “I have high roads and gardens, and I have given\\r\\nbirth to a poet who was witty and amusing, which all poets are not. I\\r\\nonce intended to equip a ship that was to sail all round the earth; but\\r\\nI did not do it, although I could have done so: and then, too, I smell\\r\\nso deliciously, for close before the gate bloom the most beautiful\\r\\nroses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n*Corsor, on the Great Belt, called, formerly, before the introduction\\r\\nof steam-vessels, when travellers were often obliged to wait a long time\\r\\nfor a favorable wind, “the most tiresome of towns.” The poet Baggesen\\r\\nwas born here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Tuk looked, and all was red and green before his eyes; but as\\r\\nsoon as the confusion of colors was somewhat over, all of a sudden there\\r\\nappeared a wooded slope close to the bay, and high up above stood a\\r\\nmagnificent old church, with two high pointed towers. From out the\\r\\nhill-side spouted fountains in thick streams of water, so that there\\r\\nwas a continual splashing; and close beside them sat an old king with\\r\\na golden crown upon his white head: that was King Hroar, near the\\r\\nfountains, close to the town of Roeskilde, as it is now called. And up\\r\\nthe slope into the old church went all the kings and queens of Denmark,\\r\\nhand in hand, all with their golden crowns; and the organ played and\\r\\nthe fountains rustled. Little Tuk saw all, heard all. “Do not forget the\\r\\ndiet,” said King Hroar.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Roeskilde, once the capital of Denmark. The town takes its name from\\r\\nKing Hroar, and the many fountains in the neighborhood. In the beautiful\\r\\ncathedral the greater number of the kings and queens of Denmark are\\r\\ninterred. In Roeskilde, too, the members of the Danish Diet assemble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain all suddenly disappeared. Yes, and whither? It seemed to him\\r\\njust as if one turned over a leaf in a book. And now stood there an\\r\\nold peasant-woman, who came from Soroe,* where grass grows in the\\r\\nmarket-place. She had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and\\r\\nback: it was so wet, it certainly must have been raining. “Yes, that it\\r\\nhas,” said she; and she now related many pretty things out of Holberg's\\r\\ncomedies, and about Waldemar and Absalon; but all at once she cowered\\r\\ntogether, and her head began shaking backwards and forwards, and she\\r\\nlooked as she were going to make a spring. “Croak! croak!” said she.\\r\\n“It is wet, it is wet; there is such a pleasant deathlike stillness in\\r\\nSorbe!” She was now suddenly a frog, “Croak”; and now she was an old\\r\\nwoman. “One must dress according to the weather,” said she. “It is wet;\\r\\nit is wet. My town is just like a bottle; and one gets in by the neck,\\r\\nand by the neck one must get out again! In former times I had the\\r\\nfinest fish, and now I have fresh rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the\\r\\nbottle, who learn wisdom, Hebrew, Greek--Croak!”\\r\\n\\r\\n* Sorbe, a very quiet little town, beautifully situated, surrounded by\\r\\nwoods and lakes. Holberg, Denmark's Moliere, founded here an academy\\r\\nfor the sons of the nobles. The poets Hauch and Ingemann were appointed\\r\\nprofessors here. The latter lives there still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she spoke it sounded just like the noise of frogs, or as if one\\r\\nwalked with great boots over a moor; always the same tone, so uniform\\r\\nand so tiring that little Tuk fell into a good sound sleep, which, by\\r\\nthe bye, could not do him any harm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even in this sleep there came a dream, or whatever else it was: his\\r\\nlittle sister Augusta, she with the blue eyes and the fair curling hair,\\r\\nwas suddenly a tall, beautiful girl, and without having wings was yet\\r\\nable to fly; and she now flew over Zealand--over the green woods and the\\r\\nblue lakes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you hear the cock crow, Tukey? Cock-a-doodle-doo! The cocks are\\r\\nflying up from Kjoge! You will have a farm-yard, so large, oh! so very\\r\\nlarge! You will suffer neither hunger nor thirst! You will get on in the\\r\\nworld! You will be a rich and happy man! Your house will exalt itself\\r\\nlike King Waldemar's tower, and will be richly decorated with marble\\r\\nstatues, like that at Prastoe. You understand what I mean. Your name\\r\\nshall circulate with renown all round the earth, like unto the ship that\\r\\nwas to have sailed from Corsor; and in Roeskilde--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not forget the diet!” said King Hroar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you will speak well and wisely, little Tukey; and when at last you\\r\\nsink into your grave, you shall sleep as quietly--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As if I lay in Soroe,” said Tuk, awaking. It was bright day, and he was\\r\\nnow quite unable to call to mind his dream; that, however, was not at\\r\\nall necessary, for one may not know what the future will bring.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd out of bed he jumped, and read in his book, and now all at once he\\r\\nknew his whole lesson. And the old washerwoman popped her head in at the\\r\\ndoor, nodded to him friendly, and said, “Thanks, many thanks, my good\\r\\nchild, for your help! May the good ever-loving God fulfil your loveliest\\r\\ndream!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Tukey did not at all know what he had dreamed, but the loving God\\r\\nknew it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NAUGHTY BOY\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old poet. As\\r\\nhe was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm arose without,\\r\\nand the rain streamed down from heaven; but the old poet sat warm\\r\\nand comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire blazed and the\\r\\nroasting apple hissed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the skin,”\\r\\n said the good old poet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh let me in! Let me in! I am cold, and I'm so wet!” exclaimed suddenly\\r\\na child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance, while\\r\\nthe rain poured down, and the wind made all the windows rattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor thing!” said the old poet, as he went to open the door. There\\r\\nstood a little boy, quite naked, and the water ran down from his long\\r\\ngolden hair; he trembled with cold, and had he not come into a warm room\\r\\nhe would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor child!” said the old poet, as he took the boy by the hand. “Come\\r\\nin, come in, and I will soon restore thee! Thou shalt have wine and\\r\\nroasted apples, for thou art verily a charming child!” And the boy was\\r\\nso really. His eyes were like two bright stars; and although the water\\r\\ntrickled down his hair, it waved in beautiful curls. He looked exactly\\r\\nlike a little angel, but he was so pale, and his whole body trembled\\r\\nwith cold. He had a nice little bow in his hand, but it was quite\\r\\nspoiled by the rain, and the tints of his many-colored arrows ran one\\r\\ninto the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old poet seated himself beside his hearth, and took the little\\r\\nfellow on his lap; he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair,\\r\\nwarmed his hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine.\\r\\nThen the boy recovered, his cheeks again grew rosy, he jumped down from\\r\\nthe lap where he was sitting, and danced round the kind old poet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a merry fellow,” said the old man. “What's your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Cupid,” answered the boy. “Don't you know me? There lies my\\r\\nbow; it shoots well, I can assure you! Look, the weather is now clearing\\r\\nup, and the moon is shining clear again through the window.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, your bow is quite spoiled,” said the old poet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That were sad indeed,” said the boy, and he took the bow in his hand\\r\\nand examined it on every side. “Oh, it is dry again, and is not hurt at\\r\\nall; the string is quite tight. I will try it directly.” And he bent his\\r\\nbow, took aim, and shot an arrow at the old poet, right into his heart.\\r\\n“You see now that my bow was not spoiled,” said he laughing; and away he\\r\\nran.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe naughty boy, to shoot the old poet in that way; he who had taken him\\r\\ninto his warm room, who had treated him so kindly, and who had given him\\r\\nwarm wine and the very best apples!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor poet lay on the earth and wept, for the arrow had really flown\\r\\ninto his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fie!” said he. “How naughty a boy Cupid is! I will tell all children\\r\\nabout him, that they may take care and not play with him, for he will\\r\\nonly cause them sorrow and many a heartache.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all good children to whom he related this story, took great heed\\r\\nof this naughty Cupid; but he made fools of them still, for he is\\r\\nastonishingly cunning. When the university students come from the\\r\\nlectures, he runs beside them in a black coat, and with a book under his\\r\\narm. It is quite impossible for them to know him, and they walk along\\r\\nwith him arm in arm, as if he, too, were a student like themselves; and\\r\\nthen, unperceived, he thrusts an arrow to their bosom. When the young\\r\\nmaidens come from being examined by the clergyman, or go to church to\\r\\nbe confirmed, there he is again close behind them. Yes, he is forever\\r\\nfollowing people. At the play, he sits in the great chandelier and burns\\r\\nin bright flames, so that people think it is really a flame, but they\\r\\nsoon discover it is something else. He roves about in the garden of the\\r\\npalace and upon the ramparts: yes, once he even shot your father and\\r\\nmother right in the heart. Ask them only and you will hear what they'll\\r\\ntell you. Oh, he is a naughty boy, that Cupid; you must never have\\r\\nanything to do with him. He is forever running after everybody. Only\\r\\nthink, he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother! But that is a\\r\\nlong time ago, and it is all past now; however, a thing of that sort she\\r\\nnever forgets. Fie, naughty Cupid! But now you know him, and you know,\\r\\ntoo, how ill-behaved he is!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RED SHOES\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate, but in\\r\\nsummer she was forced to run about with bare feet, she was so poor, and\\r\\nin winter wear very large wooden shoes, which made her little insteps\\r\\nquite red, and that looked so dangerous!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the village lived old Dame Shoemaker; she sat and sewed\\r\\ntogether, as well as she could, a little pair of shoes out of old red\\r\\nstrips of cloth; they were very clumsy, but it was a kind thought. They\\r\\nwere meant for the little girl. The little girl was called Karen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very day her mother was buried, Karen received the red shoes,\\r\\nand wore them for the first time. They were certainly not intended for\\r\\nmourning, but she had no others, and with stockingless feet she followed\\r\\nthe poor straw coffin in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly a large old carriage drove up, and a large old lady sat in it:\\r\\nshe looked at the little girl, felt compassion for her, and then said to\\r\\nthe clergyman:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here, give me the little girl. I will adopt her!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes, but\\r\\nthe old lady thought they were horrible, and they were burnt. But Karen\\r\\nherself was cleanly and nicely dressed; she must learn to read and sew;\\r\\nand people said she was a nice little thing, but the looking-glass said:\\r\\n“Thou art more than nice, thou art beautiful!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the queen once travelled through the land, and she had her little\\r\\ndaughter with her. And this little daughter was a princess, and people\\r\\nstreamed to the castle, and Karen was there also, and the little\\r\\nprincess stood in her fine white dress, in a window, and let herself be\\r\\nstared at; she had neither a train nor a golden crown, but splendid\\r\\nred morocco shoes. They were certainly far handsomer than those Dame\\r\\nShoemaker had made for little Karen. Nothing in the world can be\\r\\ncompared with red shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Karen was old enough to be confirmed; she had new clothes and was to\\r\\nhave new shoes also. The rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of\\r\\nher little foot. This took place at his house, in his room; where stood\\r\\nlarge glass-cases, filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots. All\\r\\nthis looked charming, but the old lady could not see well, and so had\\r\\nno pleasure in them. In the midst of the shoes stood a pair of red ones,\\r\\njust like those the princess had worn. How beautiful they were! The\\r\\nshoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a count, but had\\r\\nnot fitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That must be patent leather!” said the old lady. “They shine so!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they shine!” said Karen, and they fitted, and were bought, but the\\r\\nold lady knew nothing about their being red, else she would never have\\r\\nallowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed. Yet such was\\r\\nthe case.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody looked at her feet; and when she stepped through the chancel\\r\\ndoor on the church pavement, it seemed to her as if the old figures on\\r\\nthe tombs, those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives, with\\r\\nstiff ruffs, and long black dresses, fixed their eyes on her red shoes.\\r\\nAnd she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her\\r\\nhead, and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and how\\r\\nshe should be now a matured Christian; and the organ pealed so solemnly;\\r\\nthe sweet children's voices sang, and the old music-directors sang, but\\r\\nKaren only thought of her red shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had\\r\\nbeen red, and she said that it was very wrong of Karen, that it was not\\r\\nat all becoming, and that in future Karen should only go in black shoes\\r\\nto church, even when she should be older.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next Sunday there was the sacrament, and Karen looked at the black\\r\\nshoes, looked at the red ones--looked at them again, and put on the red\\r\\nshoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun shone gloriously; Karen and the old lady walked along the path\\r\\nthrough the corn; it was rather dusty there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch, and with a\\r\\nwonderfully long beard, which was more red than white, and he bowed to\\r\\nthe ground, and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes. And\\r\\nKaren stretched out her little foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“See, what beautiful dancing shoes!” said the soldier. “Sit firm when\\r\\nyou dance”; and he put his hand out towards the soles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the old lady gave the old soldier alms, and went into the church\\r\\nwith Karen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all the people in the church looked at Karen's red shoes, and all\\r\\nthe pictures, and as Karen knelt before the altar, and raised the cup to\\r\\nher lips, she only thought of the red shoes, and they seemed to swim\\r\\nin it; and she forgot to sing her psalm, and she forgot to pray, “Our\\r\\nFather in Heaven!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow all the people went out of church, and the old lady got into her\\r\\ncarriage. Karen raised her foot to get in after her, when the old\\r\\nsoldier said,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look, what beautiful dancing shoes!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Karen could not help dancing a step or two, and when she began her\\r\\nfeet continued to dance; it was just as though the shoes had power over\\r\\nthem. She danced round the church corner, she could not leave off; the\\r\\ncoachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her, and he lifted\\r\\nher in the carriage, but her feet continued to dance so that she trod on\\r\\nthe old lady dreadfully. At length she took the shoes off, and then her\\r\\nlegs had peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shoes were placed in a closet at home, but Karen could not avoid\\r\\nlooking at them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the old lady was sick, and it was said she could not recover. She\\r\\nmust be nursed and waited upon, and there was no one whose duty it was\\r\\nso much as Karen's. But there was a great ball in the city, to which\\r\\nKaren was invited. She looked at the old lady, who could not recover,\\r\\nshe looked at the red shoes, and she thought there could be no sin in\\r\\nit; she put on the red shoes, she might do that also, she thought. But\\r\\nthen she went to the ball and began to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she wanted to dance to the right, the shoes would dance to the\\r\\nleft, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced back\\r\\nagain, down the steps, into the street, and out of the city gate. She\\r\\ndanced, and was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it was suddenly light up among the trees, and she fancied it must\\r\\nbe the moon, for there was a face; but it was the old soldier with\\r\\nthe red beard; he sat there, nodded his head, and said, “Look, what\\r\\nbeautiful dancing shoes!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she was terrified, and wanted to fling off the red shoes, but they\\r\\nclung fast; and she pulled down her stockings, but the shoes seemed to\\r\\nhave grown to her feet. And she danced, and must dance, over fields and\\r\\nmeadows, in rain and sunshine, by night and day; but at night it was the\\r\\nmost fearful.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced over the churchyard, but the dead did not dance--they had\\r\\nsomething better to do than to dance. She wished to seat herself on a\\r\\npoor man's grave, where the bitter tansy grew; but for her there was\\r\\nneither peace nor rest; and when she danced towards the open church\\r\\ndoor, she saw an angel standing there. He wore long, white garments; he\\r\\nhad wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth; his countenance\\r\\nwas severe and grave; and in his hand he held a sword, broad and\\r\\nglittering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dance shalt thou!” said he. “Dance in thy red shoes till thou art pale\\r\\nand cold! Till thy skin shrivels up and thou art a skeleton! Dance shalt\\r\\nthou from door to door, and where proud, vain children dwell, thou shalt\\r\\nknock, that they may hear thee and tremble! Dance shalt thou--!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mercy!” cried Karen. But she did not hear the angel's reply, for the\\r\\nshoes carried her through the gate into the fields, across roads and\\r\\nbridges, and she must keep ever dancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning she danced past a door which she well knew. Within sounded\\r\\na psalm; a coffin, decked with flowers, was borne forth. Then she knew\\r\\nthat the old lady was dead, and felt that she was abandoned by all, and\\r\\ncondemned by the angel of God.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced, and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night. The\\r\\nshoes carried her over stack and stone; she was torn till she bled; she\\r\\ndanced over the heath till she came to a little house. Here, she knew,\\r\\ndwelt the executioner; and she tapped with her fingers at the window,\\r\\nand said, “Come out! Come out! I cannot come in, for I am forced to\\r\\ndance!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the executioner said, “Thou dost not know who I am, I fancy? I\\r\\nstrike bad people's heads off; and I hear that my axe rings!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don't strike my head off!” said Karen. “Then I can't repent of my sins!\\r\\nBut strike off my feet in the red shoes!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then she confessed her entire sin, and the executioner struck off\\r\\nher feet with the red shoes, but the shoes danced away with the little\\r\\nfeet across the field into the deep wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he carved out little wooden feet for her, and crutches, taught\\r\\nher the psalm criminals always sing; and she kissed the hand which had\\r\\nwielded the axe, and went over the heath.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now I have suffered enough for the red shoes!” said she. “Now I will\\r\\ngo into the church that people may see me!” And she hastened towards the\\r\\nchurch door: but when she was near it, the red shoes danced before her,\\r\\nand she was terrified, and turned round. The whole week she was unhappy,\\r\\nand wept many bitter tears; but when Sunday returned, she said, “Well,\\r\\nnow I have suffered and struggled enough! I really believe I am as good\\r\\nas many a one who sits in the church, and holds her head so high!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd away she went boldly; but she had not got farther than the\\r\\nchurchyard gate before she saw the red shoes dancing before her; and she\\r\\nwas frightened, and turned back, and repented of her sin from her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she went to the parsonage, and begged that they would take her\\r\\ninto service; she would be very industrious, she said, and would do\\r\\neverything she could; she did not care about the wages, only she wished\\r\\nto have a home, and be with good people. And the clergyman's wife was\\r\\nsorry for her and took her into service; and she was industrious and\\r\\nthoughtful. She sat still and listened when the clergyman read the Bible\\r\\nin the evenings. All the children thought a great deal of her; but when\\r\\nthey spoke of dress, and grandeur, and beauty, she shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following Sunday, when the family was going to church, they asked\\r\\nher whether she would not go with them; but she glanced sorrowfully,\\r\\nwith tears in her eyes, at her crutches. The family went to hear the\\r\\nword of God; but she went alone into her little chamber; there was only\\r\\nroom for a bed and chair to stand in it; and here she sat down with her\\r\\nPrayer-Book; and whilst she read with a pious mind, the wind bore\\r\\nthe strains of the organ towards her, and she raised her tearful\\r\\ncountenance, and said, “O God, help me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the sun shone so clearly, and straight before her stood the angel\\r\\nof God in white garments, the same she had seen that night at the church\\r\\ndoor; but he no longer carried the sharp sword, but in its stead a\\r\\nsplendid green spray, full of roses. And he touched the ceiling with the\\r\\nspray, and the ceiling rose so high, and where he had touched it there\\r\\ngleamed a golden star. And he touched the walls, and they widened out,\\r\\nand she saw the organ which was playing; she saw the old pictures of the\\r\\npreachers and the preachers' wives. The congregation sat in cushioned\\r\\nseats, and sang out of their Prayer-Books. For the church itself had\\r\\ncome to the poor girl in her narrow chamber, or else she had come into\\r\\nthe church. She sat in the pew with the clergyman's family, and when\\r\\nthey had ended the psalm and looked up, they nodded and said, “It is\\r\\nright that thou art come!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was through mercy!” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the organ pealed, and the children's voices in the choir sounded so\\r\\nsweet and soft! The clear sunshine streamed so warmly through the window\\r\\ninto the pew where Karen sat! Her heart was so full of sunshine, peace,\\r\\nand joy, that it broke. Her soul flew on the sunshine to God, and there\\r\\nno one asked after the RED SHOES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Andersen's Fairy Tales, by Hans Christian Andersen\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n            \""

His kingdom was very\\r\\nsmall, but still quite large enough to marry upon; and he wished to\\r\\nmarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was certainly rather cool of him to say to the Emperor's daughter,\\r\\n“Will you have me?” But so he did; for his name was renowned far and\\r\\nwide; and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered,\\r\\n“Yes!” and “Thank you kindly.” We shall see what this princess said.\\r\\n\\r\\nListen!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that where the Prince's father lay buried, there grew a rose\\r\\ntree--a most beautiful rose tree, which blossomed only once in every\\r\\nfive years, and even then bore only one flower, but that was a rose!\\r\\nIt smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who\\r\\ninhaled its fragrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd furthermore, the Prince had a nightingale, who could sing in such a\\r\\nmanner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little\\r\\nthroat. So the Princess was to have the rose, and the nightingale; and\\r\\nthey were accordingly put into large silver caskets, and sent to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor had them brought into a large hall, where the Princess was\\r\\nplaying at “Visiting,” with the ladies of the court; and when she saw\\r\\nthe caskets with the presents, she clapped her hands for joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, if it were but a little pussy-cat!” said she; but the rose tree,\\r\\nwith its beautiful rose came to view.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, how prettily it is made!” said all the court ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is more than pretty,” said the Emperor, “it is charming!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Princess touched it, and was almost ready to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fie, papa!” said she. “It is not made at all, it is natural!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us see what is in the other casket, before we get into a bad\\r\\nhumor,” said the Emperor. So the nightingale came forth and sang so\\r\\ndelightfully that at first no one could say anything ill-humored of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Superbe! Charmant!” exclaimed the ladies; for they all used to chatter\\r\\nFrench, each one worse than her neighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How much the bird reminds me of the musical box that belonged to our\\r\\nblessed Empress,” said an old knight. “Oh yes! These are the same tones,\\r\\nthe same execution.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes! yes!” said the Emperor, and he wept like a child at the\\r\\nremembrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will still hope that it is not a real bird,” said the Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it is a real bird,” said those who had brought it. “Well then let\\r\\nthe bird fly,” said the Princess; and she positively refused to see the\\r\\nPrince.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he was not to be discouraged; he daubed his face over brown and\\r\\nblack; pulled his cap over his ears, and knocked at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good day to my lord, the Emperor!” said he. “Can I have employment at\\r\\nthe palace?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, yes,” said the Emperor. “I want some one to take care of the pigs,\\r\\nfor we have a great many of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Prince was appointed “Imperial Swineherd.” He had a dirty little\\r\\nroom close by the pigsty; and there he sat the whole day, and worked. By\\r\\nthe evening he had made a pretty little kitchen-pot. Little bells were\\r\\nhung all round it; and when the pot was boiling, these bells tinkled in\\r\\nthe most charming manner, and played the old melody,\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Ach! du lieber Augustin,\\r\\n    Alles ist weg, weg, weg!”*\\r\\n\\r\\n    * “Ah! dear Augustine!\\r\\n    All is gone, gone, gone!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what was still more curious, whoever held his finger in the smoke of\\r\\nthe kitchen-pot, immediately smelt all the dishes that were cooking on\\r\\nevery hearth in the city--this, you see, was something quite different\\r\\nfrom the rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Princess happened to walk that way; and when she heard the tune,\\r\\nshe stood quite still, and seemed pleased; for she could play “Lieber\\r\\nAugustine”; it was the only piece she knew; and she played it with one\\r\\nfinger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why there is my piece,” said the Princess. “That swineherd must\\r\\ncertainly have been well educated! Go in and ask him the price of the\\r\\ninstrument.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo one of the court-ladies must run in; however, she drew on wooden\\r\\nslippers first.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What will you take for the kitchen-pot?” said the lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will have ten kisses from the Princess,” said the swineherd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, indeed!” said the lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot sell it for less,” rejoined the swineherd.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is an impudent fellow!” said the Princess, and she walked on; but\\r\\nwhen she had gone a little way, the bells tinkled so prettily\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Ach! du lieber Augustin,\\r\\n    Alles ist weg, weg, weg!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stay,” said the Princess. “Ask him if he will have ten kisses from the\\r\\nladies of my court.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, thank you!” said the swineherd. “Ten kisses from the Princess, or I\\r\\nkeep the kitchen-pot myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That must not be, either!” said the Princess. “But do you all stand\\r\\nbefore me that no one may see us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the court-ladies placed themselves in front of her, and spread\\r\\nout their dresses--the swineherd got ten kisses, and the Princess--the\\r\\nkitchen-pot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was delightful! The pot was boiling the whole evening, and the\\r\\nwhole of the following day. They knew perfectly well what was cooking at\\r\\nevery fire throughout the city, from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's;\\r\\nthe court-ladies danced and clapped their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We know who has soup, and who has pancakes for dinner to-day, who has\\r\\ncutlets, and who has eggs. How interesting!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but keep my secret, for I am an Emperor's daughter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swineherd--that is to say--the Prince, for no one knew that he was\\r\\nother than an ill-favored swineherd, let not a day pass without working\\r\\nat something; he at last constructed a rattle, which, when it was swung\\r\\nround, played all the waltzes and jig tunes, which have ever been heard\\r\\nsince the creation of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that is superbe!” said the Princess when she passed by. “I have\\r\\nnever heard prettier compositions! Go in and ask him the price of the\\r\\ninstrument; but mind, he shall have no more kisses!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He will have a hundred kisses from the Princess!” said the lady who had\\r\\nbeen to ask.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think he is not in his right senses!” said the Princess, and walked\\r\\non, but when she had gone a little way, she stopped again. “One must\\r\\nencourage art,” said she, “I am the Emperor's daughter. Tell him he\\r\\nshall, as on yesterday, have ten kisses from me, and may take the rest\\r\\nfrom the ladies of the court.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh--but we should not like that at all!” said they. “What are you\\r\\nmuttering?” asked the Princess. “If I can kiss him, surely you can.\\r\\nRemember that you owe everything to me.” So the ladies were obliged to\\r\\ngo to him again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A hundred kisses from the Princess,” said he, “or else let everyone\\r\\nkeep his own!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stand round!” said she; and all the ladies stood round her whilst the\\r\\nkissing was going on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What can be the reason for such a crowd close by the pigsty?” said the\\r\\nEmperor, who happened just then to step out on the balcony; he rubbed\\r\\nhis eyes, and put on his spectacles. “They are the ladies of the\\r\\ncourt; I must go down and see what they are about!” So he pulled up his\\r\\nslippers at the heel, for he had trodden them down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he had got into the court-yard, he moved very softly, and the\\r\\nladies were so much engrossed with counting the kisses, that all might\\r\\ngo on fairly, that they did not perceive the Emperor. He rose on his\\r\\ntiptoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is all this?” said he, when he saw what was going on, and he boxed\\r\\nthe Princess's ears with his slipper, just as the swineherd was taking\\r\\nthe eighty-sixth kiss.\\r\\n\\r\\n“March out!” said the Emperor, for he was very angry; and both Princess\\r\\nand swineherd were thrust out of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Princess now stood and wept, the swineherd scolded, and the rain\\r\\npoured down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alas! Unhappy creature that I am!” said the Princess. “If I had but\\r\\nmarried the handsome young Prince! Ah! how unfortunate I am!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the swineherd went behind a tree, washed the black and brown color\\r\\nfrom his face, threw off his dirty clothes, and stepped forth in his\\r\\nprincely robes; he looked so noble that the Princess could not help\\r\\nbowing before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am come to despise thee,” said he. “Thou would'st not have an\\r\\nhonorable Prince! Thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale,\\r\\nbut thou wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake of a trumpery\\r\\nplaything. Thou art rightly served.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then went back to his own little kingdom, and shut the door of his\\r\\npalace in her face. Now she might well sing,\\r\\n\\r\\n    “Ach! du lieber Augustin,\\r\\n    Alles ist weg, weg, weg!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE REAL PRINCESS\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a Prince who wished to marry a Princess; but then she\\r\\nmust be a real Princess. He travelled all over the world in hopes of\\r\\nfinding such a lady; but there was always something wrong. Princesses he\\r\\nfound in plenty; but whether they were real Princesses it was impossible\\r\\nfor him to decide, for now one thing, now another, seemed to him not\\r\\nquite right about the ladies. At last he returned to his palace quite\\r\\ncast down, because he wished so much to have a real Princess for his\\r\\nwife.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening a fearful tempest arose, it thundered and lightened, and the\\r\\nrain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides, it was as dark as\\r\\npitch. All at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door, and\\r\\nthe old King, the Prince's father, went out himself to open it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a Princess who was standing outside the door. What with the rain\\r\\nand the wind, she was in a sad condition; the water trickled down from\\r\\nher hair, and her clothes clung to her body. She said she was a real\\r\\nPrincess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! we shall soon see that!” thought the old Queen-mother; however, she\\r\\nsaid not a word of what she was going to do; but went quietly into the\\r\\nbedroom, took all the bed-clothes off the bed, and put three little peas\\r\\non the bedstead. She then laid twenty mattresses one upon another over\\r\\nthe three peas, and put twenty feather beds over the mattresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this bed the Princess was to pass the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she was asked how she had slept. “Oh, very badly\\r\\nindeed!” she replied. “I have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night\\r\\nthrough. I do not know what was in my bed, but I had something hard\\r\\nunder me, and am all over black and blue. It has hurt me so much!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it was plain that the lady must be a real Princess, since she had\\r\\nbeen able to feel the three little peas through the twenty mattresses\\r\\nand twenty feather beds. None but a real Princess could have had such a\\r\\ndelicate sense of feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prince accordingly made her his wife; being now convinced that he\\r\\nhad found a real Princess. The three peas were however put into the\\r\\ncabinet of curiosities, where they are still to be seen, provided they\\r\\nare not lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nWasn't this a lady of real delicacy?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SHOES OF FORTUNE\\r\\n\\r\\nI. A Beginning\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery author has some peculiarity in his descriptions or in his style\\r\\nof writing. Those who do not like him, magnify it, shrug up their\\r\\nshoulders, and exclaim--there he is again! I, for my part, know very\\r\\nwell how I can bring about this movement and this exclamation. It would\\r\\nhappen immediately if I were to begin here, as I intended to do, with:\\r\\n“Rome has its Corso, Naples its Toledo”--“Ah! that Andersen; there he is\\r\\nagain!” they would cry; yet I must, to please my fancy, continue quite\\r\\nquietly, and add: “But Copenhagen has its East Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, then, we will stay for the present. In one of the houses not far\\r\\nfrom the new market a party was invited--a very large party, in order,\\r\\nas is often the case, to get a return invitation from the others. One\\r\\nhalf of the company was already seated at the card-table, the other half\\r\\nawaited the result of the stereotype preliminary observation of the lady\\r\\nof the house:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now let us see what we can do to amuse ourselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had got just so far, and the conversation began to crystallise,\\r\\nas it could but do with the scanty stream which the commonplace world\\r\\nsupplied. Amongst other things they spoke of the middle ages: some\\r\\npraised that period as far more interesting, far more poetical than our\\r\\nown too sober present; indeed Councillor Knap defended this opinion\\r\\nso warmly, that the hostess declared immediately on his side, and both\\r\\nexerted themselves with unwearied eloquence. The Councillor boldly\\r\\ndeclared the time of King Hans to be the noblest and the most happy\\r\\nperiod.*\\r\\n\\r\\n* A.D. 1482-1513\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the conversation turned on this subject, and was only for a moment\\r\\ninterrupted by the arrival of a journal that contained nothing worth\\r\\nreading, we will just step out into the antechamber, where cloaks,\\r\\nmackintoshes, sticks, umbrellas, and shoes, were deposited. Here sat two\\r\\nfemale figures, a young and an old one. One might have thought at first\\r\\nthey were servants come to accompany their mistresses home; but on\\r\\nlooking nearer, one soon saw they could scarcely be mere servants; their\\r\\nforms were too noble for that, their skin too fine, the cut of their\\r\\ndress too striking. Two fairies were they; the younger, it is true,\\r\\nwas not Dame Fortune herself, but one of the waiting-maids of her\\r\\nhandmaidens who carry about the lesser good things that she distributes;\\r\\nthe other looked extremely gloomy--it was Care. She always attends to\\r\\nher own serious business herself, as then she is sure of having it done\\r\\nproperly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were telling each other, with a confidential interchange of ideas,\\r\\nwhere they had been during the day. The messenger of Fortune had only\\r\\nexecuted a few unimportant commissions, such as saving a new bonnet from\\r\\na shower of rain, etc.; but what she had yet to perform was something\\r\\nquite unusual.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must tell you,” said she, “that to-day is my birthday; and in honor\\r\\nof it, a pair of walking-shoes or galoshes has been entrusted to me,\\r\\nwhich I am to carry to mankind. These shoes possess the property of\\r\\ninstantly transporting him who has them on to the place or the period\\r\\nin which he most wishes to be; every wish, as regards time or place, or\\r\\nstate of being, will be immediately fulfilled, and so at last man will\\r\\nbe happy, here below.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you seriously believe it?” replied Care, in a severe tone of\\r\\nreproach. “No; he will be very unhappy, and will assuredly bless the\\r\\nmoment when he feels that he has freed himself from the fatal shoes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stupid nonsense!” said the other angrily. “I will put them here by\\r\\nthe door. Some one will make a mistake for certain and take the wrong\\r\\nones--he will be a happy man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was their conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII. What Happened to the Councillor\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late; Councillor Knap, deeply occupied with the times of King\\r\\nHans, intended to go home, and malicious Fate managed matters so that\\r\\nhis feet, instead of finding their way to his own galoshes, slipped\\r\\ninto those of Fortune. Thus caparisoned the good man walked out of the\\r\\nwell-lighted rooms into East Street. By the magic power of the shoes he\\r\\nwas carried back to the times of King Hans; on which account his foot\\r\\nvery naturally sank in the mud and puddles of the street, there having\\r\\nbeen in those days no pavement in Copenhagen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well! This is too bad! How dirty it is here!” sighed the Councillor.\\r\\n“As to a pavement, I can find no traces of one, and all the lamps, it\\r\\nseems, have gone to sleep.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon was not yet very high; it was besides rather foggy, so that\\r\\nin the darkness all objects seemed mingled in chaotic confusion. At the\\r\\nnext corner hung a votive lamp before a Madonna, but the light it gave\\r\\nwas little better than none at all; indeed, he did not observe it before\\r\\nhe was exactly under it, and his eyes fell upon the bright colors of the\\r\\npictures which represented the well-known group of the Virgin and the\\r\\ninfant Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is probably a wax-work show,” thought he; “and the people delay\\r\\ntaking down their sign in hopes of a late visitor or two.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA few persons in the costume of the time of King Hans passed quickly by\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How strange they look! The good folks come probably from a masquerade!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly was heard the sound of drums and fifes; the bright blaze of a\\r\\nfire shot up from time to time, and its ruddy gleams seemed to contend\\r\\nwith the bluish light of the torches. The Councillor stood still, and\\r\\nwatched a most strange procession pass by. First came a dozen drummers,\\r\\nwho understood pretty well how to handle their instruments; then came\\r\\nhalberdiers, and some armed with cross-bows. The principal person in the\\r\\nprocession was a priest. Astonished at what he saw, the Councillor asked\\r\\nwhat was the meaning of all this mummery, and who that man was.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That's the Bishop of Zealand,” was the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Heavens! What has taken possession of the Bishop?” sighed the\\r\\nCouncillor, shaking his head. It certainly could not be the Bishop; even\\r\\nthough he was considered the most absent man in the whole kingdom, and\\r\\npeople told the drollest anecdotes about him. Reflecting on the matter,\\r\\nand without looking right or left, the Councillor went through East\\r\\nStreet and across the Habro-Platz. The bridge leading to Palace Square\\r\\nwas not to be found; scarcely trusting his senses, the nocturnal\\r\\nwanderer discovered a shallow piece of water, and here fell in with two\\r\\nmen who very comfortably were rocking to and fro in a boat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does your honor want to cross the ferry to the Holme?” asked they.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Across to the Holme!” said the Councillor, who knew nothing of the age\\r\\nin which he at that moment was. “No, I am going to Christianshafen, to\\r\\nLittle Market Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth men stared at him in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only just tell me where the bridge is,” said he. “It is really\\r\\nunpardonable that there are no lamps here; and it is as dirty as if one\\r\\nhad to wade through a morass.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longer he spoke with the boatmen, the more unintelligible did their\\r\\nlanguage become to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don't understand your Bornholmish dialect,” said he at last, angrily,\\r\\nand turning his back upon them. He was unable to find the bridge: there\\r\\nwas no railway either. “It is really disgraceful what a state this place\\r\\nis in,” muttered he to himself. Never had his age, with which, however,\\r\\nhe was always grumbling, seemed so miserable as on this evening. “I'll\\r\\ntake a hackney-coach!” thought he. But where were the hackney-coaches?\\r\\nNot one was to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must go back to the New Market; there, it is to be hoped, I\\r\\nshall find some coaches; for if I don't, I shall never get safe to\\r\\nChristianshafen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo off he went in the direction of East Street, and had nearly got to\\r\\nthe end of it when the moon shone forth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“God bless me! What wooden scaffolding is that which they have set up\\r\\nthere?” cried he involuntarily, as he looked at East Gate, which, in\\r\\nthose days, was at the end of East Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found, however, a little side-door open, and through this he went,\\r\\nand stepped into our New Market of the present time. It was a huge\\r\\ndesolate plain; some wild bushes stood up here and there, while across\\r\\nthe field flowed a broad canal or river. Some wretched hovels for the\\r\\nDutch sailors, resembling great boxes, and after which the place was\\r\\nnamed, lay about in confused disorder on the opposite bank.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I either behold a fata morgana, or I am regularly tipsy,” whimpered out\\r\\nthe Councillor. “But what's this?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned round anew, firmly convinced that he was seriously ill. He\\r\\ngazed at the street formerly so well known to him, and now so strange in\\r\\nappearance, and looked at the houses more attentively: most of them were\\r\\nof wood, slightly put together; and many had a thatched roof.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No--I am far from well,” sighed he; “and yet I drank only one glass of\\r\\npunch; but I cannot suppose it--it was, too, really very wrong to give\\r\\nus punch and hot salmon for supper. I shall speak about it at the first\\r\\nopportunity. I have half a mind to go back again, and say what I suffer.\\r\\nBut no, that would be too silly; and Heaven only knows if they are up\\r\\nstill.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked for the house, but it had vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is really dreadful,” groaned he with increasing anxiety; “I cannot\\r\\nrecognise East Street again; there is not a single decent shop from one\\r\\nend to the other! Nothing but wretched huts can I see anywhere; just\\r\\nas if I were at Ringstead. Oh! I am ill! I can scarcely bear myself any\\r\\nlonger. Where the deuce can the house be? It must be here on this very\\r\\nspot; yet there is not the slightest idea of resemblance, to such a\\r\\ndegree has everything changed this night! At all events here are some\\r\\npeople up and stirring. Oh! oh! I am certainly very ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now hit upon a half-open door, through a chink of which a faint light\\r\\nshone. It was a sort of hostelry of those times; a kind of public-house.\\r\\nThe room had some resemblance to the clay-floored halls in Holstein; a\\r\\npretty numerous company, consisting of seamen, Copenhagen burghers, and\\r\\na few scholars, sat here in deep converse over their pewter cans, and\\r\\ngave little heed to the person who entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By your leave!” said the Councillor to the Hostess, who came bustling\\r\\ntowards him. “I've felt so queer all of a sudden; would you have the\\r\\ngoodness to send for a hackney-coach to take me to Christianshafen?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman examined him with eyes of astonishment, and shook her head;\\r\\nshe then addressed him in German. The Councillor thought she did not\\r\\nunderstand Danish, and therefore repeated his wish in German. This, in\\r\\nconnection with his costume, strengthened the good woman in the belief\\r\\nthat he was a foreigner. That he was ill, she comprehended directly; so\\r\\nshe brought him a pitcher of water, which tasted certainly pretty strong\\r\\nof the sea, although it had been fetched from the well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Councillor supported his head on his hand, drew a long breath, and\\r\\nthought over all the wondrous things he saw around him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is this the Daily News of this evening?” he asked mechanically, as he\\r\\nsaw the Hostess push aside a large sheet of paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meaning of this councillorship query remained, of course, a riddle\\r\\nto her, yet she handed him the paper without replying. It was a coarse\\r\\nwood-cut, representing a splendid meteor “as seen in the town of\\r\\nCologne,” which was to be read below in bright letters.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is very old!” said the Councillor, whom this piece of antiquity\\r\\nbegan to make considerably more cheerful. “Pray how did you come into\\r\\npossession of this rare print? It is extremely interesting, although the\\r\\nwhole is a mere fable. Such meteorous appearances are to be explained in\\r\\nthis way--that they are the reflections of the Aurora Borealis, and it\\r\\nis highly probable they are caused principally by electricity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThose persons who were sitting nearest him and heard his speech,\\r\\nstared at him in wonderment; and one of them rose, took off his hat\\r\\nrespectfully, and said with a serious countenance, “You are no doubt a\\r\\nvery learned man, Monsieur.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no,” answered the Councillor, “I can only join in conversation on\\r\\nthis topic and on that, as indeed one must do according to the demands\\r\\nof the world at present.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Modestia is a fine virtue,” continued the gentleman; “however, as to\\r\\nyour speech, I must say mihi secus videtur: yet I am willing to suspend\\r\\nmy judicium.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“May I ask with whom I have the pleasure of speaking?” asked the\\r\\nCouncillor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am a Bachelor in Theologia,” answered the gentleman with a stiff\\r\\nreverence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reply fully satisfied the Councillor; the title suited the dress.\\r\\n“He is certainly,” thought he, “some village schoolmaster--some queer\\r\\nold fellow, such as one still often meets with in Jutland.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is no locus docendi, it is true,” began the clerical gentleman;\\r\\n“yet I beg you earnestly to let us profit by your learning. Your reading\\r\\nin the ancients is, sine dubio, of vast extent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, I've read something, to be sure,” replied the Councillor. “I\\r\\nlike reading all useful works; but I do not on that account despise the\\r\\nmodern ones; 'tis only the unfortunate 'Tales of Every-day Life' that I\\r\\ncannot bear--we have enough and more than enough such in reality.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tales of Every-day Life?'” said our Bachelor inquiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean those new fangled novels, twisting and writhing themselves in\\r\\nthe dust of commonplace, which also expect to find a reading public.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” exclaimed the clerical gentleman smiling, “there is much wit in\\r\\nthem; besides they are read at court. The King likes the history of Sir\\r\\nIffven and Sir Gaudian particularly, which treats of King Arthur, and\\r\\nhis Knights of the Round Table; he has more than once joked about it\\r\\nwith his high vassals.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have not read that novel,” said the Councillor; “it must be quite a\\r\\nnew one, that Heiberg has published lately.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” answered the theologian of the time of King Hans: “that book is\\r\\nnot written by a Heiberg, but was imprinted by Godfrey von Gehmen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, is that the author's name?” said the Councillor. “It is a very\\r\\nold name, and, as well as I recollect, he was the first printer that\\r\\nappeared in Denmark.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he is our first printer,” replied the clerical gentleman hastily.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far all went on well. Some one of the worthy burghers now spoke of\\r\\nthe dreadful pestilence that had raged in the country a few years back,\\r\\nmeaning that of 1484. The Councillor imagined it was the cholera that\\r\\nwas meant, which people made so much fuss about; and the discourse\\r\\npassed off satisfactorily enough. The war of the buccaneers of 1490 was\\r\\nso recent that it could not fail being alluded to; the English\\r\\npirates had, they said, most shamefully taken their ships while in the\\r\\nroadstead; and the Councillor, before whose eyes the Herostratic [*]\\r\\nevent of 1801 still floated vividly, agreed entirely with the others in\\r\\nabusing the rascally English. With other topics he was not so fortunate;\\r\\nevery moment brought about some new confusion, and threatened to become\\r\\na perfect Babel; for the worthy Bachelor was really too ignorant, and\\r\\nthe simplest observations of the Councillor sounded to him too daring\\r\\nand phantastical. They looked at one another from the crown of the head\\r\\nto the soles of the feet; and when matters grew to too high a\\r\\npitch, then the Bachelor talked Latin, in the hope of being better\\r\\nunderstood--but it was of no use after all.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * Herostratus, or Eratostratus--an Ephesian, who wantonly\\r\\n     set fire to the famous temple of Diana, in order to\\r\\n     commemorate his name by so uncommon an action.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What's the matter?” asked the Hostess, plucking the Councillor by the\\r\\nsleeve; and now his recollection returned, for in the course of the\\r\\nconversation he had entirely forgotten all that had preceded it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Merciful God, where am I!” exclaimed he in agony; and while he so\\r\\nthought, all his ideas and feelings of overpowering dizziness, against\\r\\nwhich he struggled with the utmost power of desperation, encompassed\\r\\nhim with renewed force. “Let us drink claret and mead, and Bremen beer,”\\r\\n shouted one of the guests--“and you shall drink with us!”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo maidens approached. One wore a cap of two staring colors, denoting\\r\\nthe class of persons to which she belonged. They poured out the liquor,\\r\\nand made the most friendly gesticulations; while a cold perspiration\\r\\ntrickled down the back of the poor Councillor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What's to be the end of this! What's to become of me!” groaned he; but\\r\\nhe was forced, in spite of his opposition, to drink with the rest. They\\r\\ntook hold of the worthy man; who, hearing on every side that he was\\r\\nintoxicated, did not in the least doubt the truth of this certainly\\r\\nnot very polite assertion; but on the contrary, implored the ladies\\r\\nand gentlemen present to procure him a hackney-coach: they, however,\\r\\nimagined he was talking Russian.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever before, he thought, had he been in such a coarse and ignorant\\r\\ncompany; one might almost fancy the people had turned heathens again.\\r\\n“It is the most dreadful moment of my life: the whole world is leagued\\r\\nagainst me!” But suddenly it occurred to him that he might stoop down\\r\\nunder the table, and then creep unobserved out of the door. He did so;\\r\\nbut just as he was going, the others remarked what he was about; they\\r\\nlaid hold of him by the legs; and now, happily for him, off fell his\\r\\nfatal shoes--and with them the charm was at an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Councillor saw quite distinctly before him a lantern burning, and\\r\\nbehind this a large handsome house. All seemed to him in proper order as\\r\\nusual; it was East Street, splendid and elegant as we now see it. He lay\\r\\nwith his feet towards a doorway, and exactly opposite sat the watchman\\r\\nasleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gracious Heaven!” said he. “Have I lain here in the street and dreamed?\\r\\nYes; 'tis East Street! How splendid and light it is! But really it is\\r\\nterrible what an effect that one glass of punch must have had on me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo minutes later, he was sitting in a hackney-coach and driving to\\r\\nFrederickshafen. He thought of the distress and agony he had endured,\\r\\nand praised from the very bottom of his heart the happy reality--our own\\r\\ntime--which, with all its deficiencies, is yet much better than that in\\r\\nwhich, so much against his inclination, he had lately been.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII. The Watchman's Adventure\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, there is a pair of galoshes, as sure as I'm alive!” said the\\r\\nwatchman, awaking from a gentle slumber. “They belong no doubt to the\\r\\nlieutenant who lives over the way. They lie close to the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worthy man was inclined to ring and deliver them at the house, for\\r\\nthere was still a light in the window; but he did not like disturbing\\r\\nthe other people in their beds, and so very considerately he left the\\r\\nmatter alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Such a pair of shoes must be very warm and comfortable,” said he; “the\\r\\nleather is so soft and supple.” They fitted his feet as though they\\r\\nhad been made for him. “'Tis a curious world we live in,” continued he,\\r\\nsoliloquizing. “There is the lieutenant, now, who might go quietly to\\r\\nbed if he chose, where no doubt he could stretch himself at his ease;\\r\\nbut does he do it? No; he saunters up and down his room, because,\\r\\nprobably, he has enjoyed too many of the good things of this world at\\r\\nhis dinner. That's a happy fellow! He has neither an infirm mother, nor\\r\\na whole troop of everlastingly hungry children to torment him. Every\\r\\nevening he goes to a party, where his nice supper costs him nothing:\\r\\nwould to Heaven I could but change with him! How happy should I be!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile expressing his wish, the charm of the shoes, which he had put on,\\r\\nbegan to work; the watchman entered into the being and nature of the\\r\\nlieutenant. He stood in the handsomely furnished apartment, and held\\r\\nbetween his fingers a small sheet of rose-colored paper, on which some\\r\\nverses were written--written indeed by the officer himself; for who has\\r\\nnot, at least once in his life, had a lyrical moment? And if one then\\r\\nmarks down one's thoughts, poetry is produced. But here was written:\\r\\n\\r\\n                  OH, WERE I RICH!\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Oh, were I rich! Such was my wish, yea such\\r\\n      When hardly three feet high, I longed for much.\\r\\n       Oh, were I rich! an officer were I,\\r\\n       With sword, and uniform, and plume so high.\\r\\n       And the time came, and officer was I!\\r\\n     But yet I grew not rich. Alas, poor me!\\r\\n     Have pity, Thou, who all man's wants dost see.\\r\\n\\r\\n        “I sat one evening sunk in dreams of bliss,\\r\\n      A maid of seven years old gave me a kiss,\\r\\n       I at that time was rich in poesy\\r\\n       And tales of old, though poor as poor could be;\\r\\n       But all she asked for was this poesy.\\r\\n     Then was I rich, but not in gold, poor me!\\r\\n     As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.\\r\\n\\r\\n        “Oh, were I rich! Oft asked I for this boon.\\r\\n      The child grew up to womanhood full soon.\\r\\n       She is so pretty, clever, and so kind\\r\\n     Oh, did she know what's hidden in my mind--\\r\\n       A tale of old. Would she to me were kind!\\r\\n     But I'm condemned to silence! oh, poor me!\\r\\n     As Thou dost know, who all men's hearts canst see.\\r\\n\\r\\n        “Oh, were I rich in calm and peace of mind,\\r\\n      My grief you then would not here written find!\\r\\n       O thou, to whom I do my heart devote,\\r\\n       Oh read this page of glad days now remote,\\r\\n       A dark, dark tale, which I tonight devote!\\r\\n     Dark is the future now. Alas, poor me!\\r\\n     Have pity Thou, who all men's pains dost see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch verses as these people write when they are in love! But no man\\r\\nin his senses ever thinks of printing them. Here one of the sorrows of\\r\\nlife, in which there is real poetry, gave itself vent; not that\\r\\nbarren grief which the poet may only hint at, but never depict in its\\r\\ndetail--misery and want: that animal necessity, in short, to snatch\\r\\nat least at a fallen leaf of the bread-fruit tree, if not at the fruit\\r\\nitself. The higher the position in which one finds oneself transplanted,\\r\\nthe greater is the suffering. Everyday necessity is the stagnant pool of\\r\\nlife--no lovely picture reflects itself therein. Lieutenant, love, and\\r\\nlack of money--that is a symbolic triangle, or much the same as the\\r\\nhalf of the shattered die of Fortune. This the lieutenant felt most\\r\\npoignantly, and this was the reason he leant his head against the\\r\\nwindow, and sighed so deeply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The poor watchman out there in the street is far happier than I. He\\r\\nknows not what I term privation. He has a home, a wife, and children,\\r\\nwho weep with him over his sorrows, who rejoice with him when he is\\r\\nglad. Oh, far happier were I, could I exchange with him my being--with\\r\\nhis desires and with his hopes perform the weary pilgrimage of life! Oh,\\r\\nhe is a hundred times happier than I!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same moment the watchman was again watchman. It was the shoes\\r\\nthat caused the metamorphosis by means of which, unknown to himself, he\\r\\ntook upon him the thoughts and feelings of the officer; but, as we have\\r\\njust seen, he felt himself in his new situation much less contented,\\r\\nand now preferred the very thing which but some minutes before he had\\r\\nrejected. So then the watchman was again watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was an unpleasant dream,” said he; “but 'twas droll enough\\r\\naltogether. I fancied that I was the lieutenant over there: and yet\\r\\nthe thing was not very much to my taste after all. I missed my good old\\r\\nmother and the dear little ones; who almost tear me to pieces for sheer\\r\\nlove.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seated himself once more and nodded: the dream continued to haunt\\r\\nhim, for he still had the shoes on his feet. A falling star shone in the\\r\\ndark firmament.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There falls another star,” said he: “but what does it matter; there\\r\\nare always enough left. I should not much mind examining the little\\r\\nglimmering things somewhat nearer, especially the moon; for that would\\r\\nnot slip so easily through a man's fingers. When we die--so at least\\r\\nsays the student, for whom my wife does the washing--we shall fly about\\r\\nas light as a feather from one such a star to the other. That's, of\\r\\ncourse, not true: but 'twould be pretty enough if it were so. If I could\\r\\nbut once take a leap up there, my body might stay here on the steps for\\r\\nwhat I care.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBehold--there are certain things in the world to which one ought never\\r\\nto give utterance except with the greatest caution; but doubly careful\\r\\nmust one be when we have the Shoes of Fortune on our feet. Now just\\r\\nlisten to what happened to the watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to ourselves, we all know the speed produced by the employment of\\r\\nsteam; we have experienced it either on railroads, or in boats when\\r\\ncrossing the sea; but such a flight is like the travelling of a sloth in\\r\\ncomparison with the velocity with which light moves. It flies nineteen\\r\\nmillion times faster than the best race-horse; and yet electricity is\\r\\nquicker still. Death is an electric shock which our heart receives; the\\r\\nfreed soul soars upwards on the wings of electricity. The sun's light\\r\\nwants eight minutes and some seconds to perform a journey of more than\\r\\ntwenty million of our Danish [*] miles; borne by electricity, the soul\\r\\nwants even some minutes less to accomplish the same flight. To it the\\r\\nspace between the heavenly bodies is not greater than the distance\\r\\nbetween the homes of our friends in town is for us, even if they live a\\r\\nshort way from each other; such an electric shock in the heart, however,\\r\\ncosts us the use of the body here below; unless, like the watchman of\\r\\nEast Street, we happen to have on the Shoes of Fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * A Danish mile is nearly 4 3/4 English.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few seconds the watchman had done the fifty-two thousand of our\\r\\nmiles up to the moon, which, as everyone knows, was formed out of\\r\\nmatter much lighter than our earth; and is, so we should say, as soft\\r\\nas newly-fallen snow. He found himself on one of the many circumjacent\\r\\nmountain-ridges with which we are acquainted by means of Dr. Madler's\\r\\n“Map of the Moon.” Within, down it sunk perpendicularly into a caldron,\\r\\nabout a Danish mile in depth; while below lay a town, whose appearance\\r\\nwe can, in some measure, realize to ourselves by beating the white of\\r\\nan egg in a glass of water. The matter of which it was built was just as\\r\\nsoft, and formed similar towers, and domes, and pillars, transparent and\\r\\nrocking in the thin air; while above his head our earth was rolling like\\r\\na large fiery ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe perceived immediately a quantity of beings who were certainly what\\r\\nwe call “men”; yet they looked different to us. A far more correct\\r\\nimagination than that of the pseudo-Herschel* had created them; and\\r\\nif they had been placed in rank and file, and copied by some skilful\\r\\npainter's hand, one would, without doubt, have exclaimed involuntarily,\\r\\n“What a beautiful arabesque!”\\r\\n\\r\\n*This relates to a book published some years ago in Germany, and said\\r\\nto be by Herschel, which contained a description of the moon and its\\r\\ninhabitants, written with such a semblance of truth that many were\\r\\ndeceived by the imposture.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably a translation of the celebrated Moon hoax, written by Richard\\r\\nA. Locke, and originally published in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had a language too; but surely nobody can expect that the soul of\\r\\nthe watchman should understand it. Be that as it may, it did comprehend\\r\\nit; for in our souls there germinate far greater powers than we poor\\r\\nmortals, despite all our cleverness, have any notion of. Does she\\r\\nnot show us--she the queen in the land of enchantment--her astounding\\r\\ndramatic talent in all our dreams? There every acquaintance appears and\\r\\nspeaks upon the stage, so entirely in character, and with the same tone\\r\\nof voice, that none of us, when awake, were able to imitate it. How\\r\\nwell can she recall persons to our mind, of whom we have not thought for\\r\\nyears; when suddenly they step forth “every inch a man,” resembling the\\r\\nreal personages, even to the finest features, and become the heroes\\r\\nor heroines of our world of dreams. In reality, such remembrances are\\r\\nrather unpleasant: every sin, every evil thought, may, like a clock with\\r\\nalarm or chimes, be repeated at pleasure; then the question is if we can\\r\\ntrust ourselves to give an account of every unbecoming word in our heart\\r\\nand on our lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe watchman's spirit understood the language of the inhabitants of the\\r\\nmoon pretty well. The Selenites* disputed variously about our earth,\\r\\nand expressed their doubts if it could be inhabited: the air, they said,\\r\\nmust certainly be too dense to allow any rational dweller in the moon\\r\\nthe necessary free respiration. They considered the moon alone to\\r\\nbe inhabited: they imagined it was the real heart of the universe or\\r\\nplanetary system, on which the genuine Cosmopolites, or citizens of the\\r\\nworld, dwelt. What strange things men--no, what strange things Selenites\\r\\nsometimes take into their heads!\\r\\n\\r\\n* Dwellers in the moon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout politics they had a good deal to say. But little Denmark must\\r\\ntake care what it is about, and not run counter to the moon; that\\r\\ngreat realm, that might in an ill-humor bestir itself, and dash down a\\r\\nhail-storm in our faces, or force the Baltic to overflow the sides of\\r\\nits gigantic basin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will, therefore, not listen to what was spoken, and on no condition\\r\\nrun in the possibility of telling tales out of school; but we will\\r\\nrather proceed, like good quiet citizens, to East Street, and observe\\r\\nwhat happened meanwhile to the body of the watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat lifeless on the steps: the morning-star,* that is to say, the\\r\\nheavy wooden staff, headed with iron spikes, and which had nothing else\\r\\nin common with its sparkling brother in the sky, had glided from his\\r\\nhand; while his eyes were fixed with glassy stare on the moon, looking\\r\\nfor the good old fellow of a spirit which still haunted it.\\r\\n\\r\\n*The watchmen in Germany, had formerly, and in some places they still\\r\\ncarry with them, on their rounds at night, a sort of mace or club, known\\r\\nin ancient times by the above denomination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What's the hour, watchman?” asked a passer-by. But when the watchman\\r\\ngave no reply, the merry roysterer, who was now returning home from a\\r\\nnoisy drinking bout, took it into his head to try what a tweak of the\\r\\nnose would do, on which the supposed sleeper lost his balance, the body\\r\\nlay motionless, stretched out on the pavement: the man was dead. When\\r\\nthe patrol came up, all his comrades, who comprehended nothing of the\\r\\nwhole affair, were seized with a dreadful fright, for dead he was,\\r\\nand he remained so. The proper authorities were informed of the\\r\\ncircumstance, people talked a good deal about it, and in the morning the\\r\\nbody was carried to the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that would be a very pretty joke, if the spirit when it came back\\r\\nand looked for the body in East Street, were not to find one. No doubt\\r\\nit would, in its anxiety, run off to the police, and then to the\\r\\n“Hue and Cry” office, to announce that “the finder will be handsomely\\r\\nrewarded,” and at last away to the hospital; yet we may boldly assert\\r\\nthat the soul is shrewdest when it shakes off every fetter, and every\\r\\nsort of leading-string--the body only makes it stupid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seemingly dead body of the watchman wandered, as we have said, to\\r\\nthe hospital, where it was brought into the general viewing-room:\\r\\nand the first thing that was done here was naturally to pull off the\\r\\ngaloshes--when the spirit, that was merely gone out on adventures, must\\r\\nhave returned with the quickness of lightning to its earthly tenement.\\r\\nIt took its direction towards the body in a straight line; and a few\\r\\nseconds after, life began to show itself in the man. He asserted that\\r\\nthe preceding night had been the worst that ever the malice of fate had\\r\\nallotted him; he would not for two silver marks again go through what he\\r\\nhad endured while moon-stricken; but now, however, it was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same day he was discharged from the hospital as perfectly cured; but\\r\\nthe Shoes meanwhile remained behind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV. A Moment of Head Importance--An Evening's “Dramatic Readings”--A\\r\\nMost Strange Journey\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery inhabitant of Copenhagen knows, from personal inspection, how\\r\\nthe entrance to Frederick's Hospital looks; but as it is possible that\\r\\nothers, who are not Copenhagen people, may also read this little work,\\r\\nwe will beforehand give a short description of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extensive building is separated from the street by a pretty high\\r\\nrailing, the thick iron bars of which are so far apart, that in\\r\\nall seriousness, it is said, some very thin fellow had of a night\\r\\noccasionally squeezed himself through to go and pay his little visits\\r\\nin the town. The part of the body most difficult to manage on such\\r\\noccasions was, no doubt, the head; here, as is so often the case in\\r\\nthe world, long-headed people get through best. So much, then, for the\\r\\nintroduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the young men, whose head, in a physical sense only, might be\\r\\nsaid to be of the thickest, had the watch that evening. The rain poured\\r\\ndown in torrents; yet despite these two obstacles, the young man was\\r\\nobliged to go out, if it were but for a quarter of an hour; and as\\r\\nto telling the door-keeper about it, that, he thought, was quite\\r\\nunnecessary, if, with a whole skin, he were able to slip through the\\r\\nrailings. There, on the floor lay the galoshes, which the watchman\\r\\nhad forgotten; he never dreamed for a moment that they were those of\\r\\nFortune; and they promised to do him good service in the wet; so he put\\r\\nthem on. The question now was, if he could squeeze himself through the\\r\\ngrating, for he had never tried before. Well, there he stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would to Heaven I had got my head through!” said he, involuntarily; and\\r\\ninstantly through it slipped, easily and without pain, notwithstanding\\r\\nit was pretty large and thick. But now the rest of the body was to be\\r\\ngot through!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! I am much too stout,” groaned he aloud, while fixed as in a vice.\\r\\n“I had thought the head was the most difficult part of the matter--oh!\\r\\noh! I really cannot squeeze myself through!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now wanted to pull his over-hasty head back again, but he could not.\\r\\nFor his neck there was room enough, but for nothing more. His first\\r\\nfeeling was of anger; his next that his temper fell to zero. The\\r\\nShoes of Fortune had placed him in the most dreadful situation; and,\\r\\nunfortunately, it never occurred to him to wish himself free. The\\r\\npitch-black clouds poured down their contents in still heavier torrents;\\r\\nnot a creature was to be seen in the streets. To reach up to the bell\\r\\nwas what he did not like; to cry aloud for help would have availed him\\r\\nlittle; besides, how ashamed would he have been to be found caught in a\\r\\ntrap, like an outwitted fox! How was he to twist himself through! He saw\\r\\nclearly that it was his irrevocable destiny to remain a prisoner till\\r\\ndawn, or, perhaps, even late in the morning; then the smith must be\\r\\nfetched to file away the bars; but all that would not be done so quickly\\r\\nas he could think about it. The whole Charity School, just opposite,\\r\\nwould be in motion; all the new booths, with their not very\\r\\ncourtier-like swarm of seamen, would join them out of curiosity, and\\r\\nwould greet him with a wild “hurrah!” while he was standing in his\\r\\npillory: there would be a mob, a hissing, and rejoicing, and jeering,\\r\\nten times worse than in the rows about the Jews some years ago--“Oh, my\\r\\nblood is mounting to my brain; 'tis enough to drive one mad! I shall go\\r\\nwild! I know not what to do. Oh! were I but loose; my dizziness would\\r\\nthen cease; oh, were my head but loose!”\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see he ought to have said that sooner; for the moment he expressed\\r\\nthe wish his head was free; and cured of all his paroxysms of love, he\\r\\nhastened off to his room, where the pains consequent on the fright the\\r\\nShoes had prepared for him, did not so soon take their leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you must not think that the affair is over now; it grows much worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night passed, the next day also; but nobody came to fetch the Shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening “Dramatic Readings” were to be given at the little\\r\\ntheatre in King Street. The house was filled to suffocation; and among\\r\\nother pieces to be recited was a new poem by H. C. Andersen, called, My\\r\\nAunt's Spectacles; the contents of which were pretty nearly as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n“A certain person had an aunt, who boasted of particular skill in\\r\\nfortune-telling with cards, and who was constantly being stormed by\\r\\npersons that wanted to have a peep into futurity. But she was full of\\r\\nmystery about her art, in which a certain pair of magic spectacles\\r\\ndid her essential service. Her nephew, a merry boy, who was his aunt's\\r\\ndarling, begged so long for these spectacles, that, at last, she lent\\r\\nhim the treasure, after having informed him, with many exhortations,\\r\\nthat in order to execute the interesting trick, he need only repair to\\r\\nsome place where a great many persons were assembled; and then, from a\\r\\nhigher position, whence he could overlook the crowd, pass the company in\\r\\nreview before him through his spectacles. Immediately 'the inner man' of\\r\\neach individual would be displayed before him, like a game of cards, in\\r\\nwhich he unerringly might read what the future of every person presented\\r\\nwas to be. Well pleased the little magician hastened away to prove the\\r\\npowers of the spectacles in the theatre; no place seeming to him more\\r\\nfitted for such a trial. He begged permission of the worthy audience,\\r\\nand set his spectacles on his nose. A motley phantasmagoria presents\\r\\nitself before him, which he describes in a few satirical touches, yet\\r\\nwithout expressing his opinion openly: he tells the people enough to set\\r\\nthem all thinking and guessing; but in order to hurt nobody, he wraps\\r\\nhis witty oracular judgments in a transparent veil, or rather in a lurid\\r\\nthundercloud, shooting forth bright sparks of wit, that they may fall in\\r\\nthe powder-magazine of the expectant audience.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe humorous poem was admirably recited, and the speaker much applauded.\\r\\nAmong the audience was the young man of the hospital, who seemed to have\\r\\nforgotten his adventure of the preceding night. He had on the Shoes; for\\r\\nas yet no lawful owner had appeared to claim them; and besides it was so\\r\\nvery dirty out-of-doors, they were just the thing for him, he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beginning of the poem he praised with great generosity: he even\\r\\nfound the idea original and effective. But that the end of it, like the\\r\\nRhine, was very insignificant, proved, in his opinion, the author's\\r\\nwant of invention; he was without genius, etc. This was an excellent\\r\\nopportunity to have said something clever.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile he was haunted by the idea--he should like to possess such a\\r\\npair of spectacles himself; then, perhaps, by using them circumspectly,\\r\\none would be able to look into people's hearts, which, he thought, would\\r\\nbe far more interesting than merely to see what was to happen next year;\\r\\nfor that we should all know in proper time, but the other never.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can now,” said he to himself, “fancy the whole row of ladies and\\r\\ngentlemen sitting there in the front row; if one could but see into\\r\\ntheir hearts--yes, that would be a revelation--a sort of bazar. In that\\r\\nlady yonder, so strangely dressed, I should find for certain a large\\r\\nmilliner's shop; in that one the shop is empty, but it wants cleaning\\r\\nplain enough. But there would also be some good stately shops among\\r\\nthem. Alas!” sighed he, “I know one in which all is stately; but there\\r\\nsits already a spruce young shopman, which is the only thing that's\\r\\namiss in the whole shop. All would be splendidly decked out, and we\\r\\nshould hear, 'Walk in, gentlemen, pray walk in; here you will find all\\r\\nyou please to want.' Ah! I wish to Heaven I could walk in and take a\\r\\ntrip right through the hearts of those present!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd behold! to the Shoes of Fortune this was the cue; the whole man\\r\\nshrunk together and a most uncommon journey through the hearts of the\\r\\nfront row of spectators, now began. The first heart through which he\\r\\ncame, was that of a middle-aged lady, but he instantly fancied himself\\r\\nin the room of the “Institution for the cure of the crooked and\\r\\ndeformed,” where casts of mis-shapen limbs are displayed in naked\\r\\nreality on the wall. Yet there was this difference, in the institution\\r\\nthe casts were taken at the entry of the patient; but here they were\\r\\nretained and guarded in the heart while the sound persons went away.\\r\\nThey were, namely, casts of female friends, whose bodily or mental\\r\\ndeformities were here most faithfully preserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the snake-like writhings of an idea he glided into another female\\r\\nheart; but this seemed to him like a large holy fane. [*] The white dove of\\r\\ninnocence fluttered over the altar. How gladly would he have sunk upon\\r\\nhis knees; but he must away to the next heart; yet he still heard the\\r\\npealing tones of the organ, and he himself seemed to have become a newer\\r\\nand a better man; he felt unworthy to tread the neighboring sanctuary\\r\\nwhich a poor garret, with a sick bed-rid mother, revealed. But God's\\r\\nwarm sun streamed through the open window; lovely roses nodded from\\r\\nthe wooden flower-boxes on the roof, and two sky-blue birds sang\\r\\nrejoicingly, while the sick mother implored God's richest blessings on\\r\\nher pious daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * temple\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now crept on hands and feet through a butcher's shop; at least on\\r\\nevery side, and above and below, there was nought but flesh. It was the\\r\\nheart of a most respectable rich man, whose name is certain to be found\\r\\nin the Directory.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was now in the heart of the wife of this worthy gentleman. It was an\\r\\nold, dilapidated, mouldering dovecot. The husband's portrait was used as\\r\\na weather-cock, which was connected in some way or other with the doors,\\r\\nand so they opened and shut of their own accord, whenever the stern old\\r\\nhusband turned round.\\r\\n\\r\\nHereupon he wandered into a boudoir formed entirely of mirrors, like\\r\\nthe one in Castle Rosenburg; but here the glasses magnified to an\\r\\nastonishing degree. On the floor, in the middle of the room, sat, like a\\r\\nDalai-Lama, the insignificant “Self” of the person, quite confounded at\\r\\nhis own greatness. He then imagined he had got into a needle-case full\\r\\nof pointed needles of every size.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is certainly the heart of an old maid,” thought he. But he was\\r\\nmistaken. It was the heart of a young military man; a man, as people\\r\\nsaid, of talent and feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the greatest perplexity, he now came out of the last heart in the\\r\\nrow; he was unable to put his thoughts in order, and fancied that his\\r\\ntoo lively imagination had run away with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Heavens!” sighed he. “I have surely a disposition to madness--'tis\\r\\ndreadfully hot here; my blood boils in my veins and my head is burning\\r\\nlike a coal.” And he now remembered the important event of the evening\\r\\nbefore, how his head had got jammed in between the iron railings of the\\r\\nhospital. “That's what it is, no doubt,” said he. “I must do something\\r\\nin time: under such circumstances a Russian bath might do me good. I\\r\\nonly wish I were already on the upper bank.” [*]\\r\\n\\r\\n     *In these Russian (vapor) baths the person extends himself\\r\\n     on a bank or form, and as he gets accustomed to the heat,\\r\\n     moves to another higher up towards the ceiling, where, of\\r\\n     course, the vapor is warmest. In this manner he ascends\\r\\n     gradually to the highest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so there he lay on the uppermost bank in the vapor-bath; but with\\r\\nall his clothes on, in his boots and galoshes, while the hot drops fell\\r\\nscalding from the ceiling on his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holloa!” cried he, leaping down. The bathing attendant, on his side,\\r\\nuttered a loud cry of astonishment when he beheld in the bath, a man\\r\\ncompletely dressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other, however, retained sufficient presence of mind to whisper to\\r\\nhim, “'Tis a bet, and I have won it!” But the first thing he did as soon\\r\\nas he got home, was to have a large blister put on his chest and back to\\r\\ndraw out his madness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning he had a sore chest and a bleeding back; and, excepting\\r\\nthe fright, that was all that he had gained by the Shoes of Fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV. Metamorphosis of the Copying-Clerk\\r\\n\\r\\nThe watchman, whom we have certainly not forgotten, thought meanwhile\\r\\nof the galoshes he had found and taken with him to the hospital; he now\\r\\nwent to fetch them; and as neither the lieutenant, nor anybody else in\\r\\nthe street, claimed them as his property, they were delivered over to\\r\\nthe police-office.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*As on the continent, in all law and police practices nothing is verbal,\\r\\nbut any circumstance, however trifling, is reduced to writing, the\\r\\nlabor, as well as the number of papers that thus accumulate, is\\r\\nenormous. In a police-office, consequently, we find copying-clerks among\\r\\nmany other scribes of various denominations, of which, it seems, our\\r\\nhero was one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, I declare the Shoes look just like my own,” said one of the\\r\\nclerks, eying the newly-found treasure, whose hidden powers, even he,\\r\\nsharp as he was, was not able to discover. “One must have more than\\r\\nthe eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the other,” said he,\\r\\nsoliloquizing; and putting, at the same time, the galoshes in search of\\r\\nan owner, beside his own in the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here, sir!” said one of the men, who panting brought him a tremendous\\r\\npile of papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe copying-clerk turned round and spoke awhile with the man about the\\r\\nreports and legal documents in question; but when he had finished, and\\r\\nhis eye fell again on the Shoes, he was unable to say whether those to\\r\\nthe left or those to the right belonged to him. “At all events it must\\r\\nbe those which are wet,” thought he; but this time, in spite of his\\r\\ncleverness, he guessed quite wrong, for it was just those of Fortune\\r\\nwhich played as it were into his hands, or rather on his feet. And why,\\r\\nI should like to know, are the police never to be wrong? So he put them\\r\\non quickly, stuck his papers in his pocket, and took besides a few under\\r\\nhis arm, intending to look them through at home to make the necessary\\r\\nnotes. It was noon; and the weather, that had threatened rain, began\\r\\nto clear up, while gaily dressed holiday folks filled the streets. “A\\r\\nlittle trip to Fredericksburg would do me no great harm,” thought he;\\r\\n“for I, poor beast of burden that I am, have so much to annoy me, that I\\r\\ndon't know what a good appetite is. 'Tis a bitter crust, alas! at which\\r\\nI am condemned to gnaw!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody could be more steady or quiet than this young man; we therefore\\r\\nwish him joy of the excursion with all our heart; and it will certainly\\r\\nbe beneficial for a person who leads so sedentary a life. In the park\\r\\nhe met a friend, one of our young poets, who told him that the following\\r\\nday he should set out on his long-intended tour.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you are going away again!” said the clerk. “You are a very free\\r\\nand happy being; we others are chained by the leg and held fast to our\\r\\ndesk.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; but it is a chain, friend, which ensures you the blessed bread\\r\\nof existence,” answered the poet. “You need feel no care for the coming\\r\\nmorrow: when you are old, you receive a pension.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“True,” said the clerk, shrugging his shoulders; “and yet you are\\r\\nthe better off. To sit at one's ease and poetise--that is a pleasure;\\r\\neverybody has something agreeable to say to you, and you are always your\\r\\nown master. No, friend, you should but try what it is to sit from one\\r\\nyear's end to the other occupied with and judging the most trivial\\r\\nmatters.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet shook his head, the copying-clerk did the same. Each one kept\\r\\nto his own opinion, and so they separated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It's a strange race, those poets!” said the clerk, who was very fond of\\r\\nsoliloquizing. “I should like some day, just for a trial, to take such\\r\\nnature upon me, and be a poet myself; I am very sure I should make\\r\\nno such miserable verses as the others. Today, methinks, is a most\\r\\ndelicious day for a poet. Nature seems anew to celebrate her awakening\\r\\ninto life. The air is so unusually clear, the clouds sail on so\\r\\nbuoyantly, and from the green herbage a fragrance is exhaled that fills\\r\\nme with delight. For many a year have I not felt as at this moment.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see already, by the foregoing effusion, that he is become a poet; to\\r\\ngive further proof of it, however, would in most cases be insipid, for\\r\\nit is a most foolish notion to fancy a poet different from other men.\\r\\nAmong the latter there may be far more poetical natures than many an\\r\\nacknowledged poet, when examined more closely, could boast of; the\\r\\ndifference only is, that the poet possesses a better mental memory, on\\r\\nwhich account he is able to retain the feeling and the thought till they\\r\\ncan be embodied by means of words; a faculty which the others do not\\r\\npossess. But the transition from a commonplace nature to one that is\\r\\nrichly endowed, demands always a more or less breakneck leap over a\\r\\ncertain abyss which yawns threateningly below; and thus must the sudden\\r\\nchange with the clerk strike the reader.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The sweet air!” continued he of the police-office, in his dreamy\\r\\nimaginings; “how it reminds me of the violets in the garden of my aunt\\r\\nMagdalena! Yes, then I was a little wild boy, who did not go to school\\r\\nvery regularly. O heavens! 'tis a long time since I have thought on\\r\\nthose times. The good old soul! She lived behind the Exchange. She\\r\\nalways had a few twigs or green shoots in water--let the winter rage\\r\\nwithout as it might. The violets exhaled their sweet breath, whilst I\\r\\npressed against the windowpanes covered with fantastic frost-work the\\r\\ncopper coin I had heated on the stove, and so made peep-holes.\\r\\nWhat splendid vistas were then opened to my view! What change--what\\r\\nmagnificence! Yonder in the canal lay the ships frozen up, and deserted\\r\\nby their whole crews, with a screaming crow for the sole occupant. But\\r\\nwhen the spring, with a gentle stirring motion, announced her arrival,\\r\\na new and busy life arose; with songs and hurrahs the ice was sawn\\r\\nasunder, the ships were fresh tarred and rigged, that they might sail\\r\\naway to distant lands. But I have remained here--must always remain\\r\\nhere, sitting at my desk in the office, and patiently see other people\\r\\nfetch their passports to go abroad. Such is my fate! Alas!”--sighed he,\\r\\nand was again silent. “Great Heaven! What is come to me! Never have I\\r\\nthought or felt like this before! It must be the summer air that affects\\r\\nme with feelings almost as disquieting as they are refreshing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt in his pocket for the papers. “These police-reports will soon\\r\\nstem the torrent of my ideas, and effectually hinder any rebellious\\r\\noverflowing of the time-worn banks of official duties”; he said to\\r\\nhimself consolingly, while his eye ran over the first page. “DAME\\r\\nTIGBRITH, tragedy in five acts.” “What is that? And yet it is undeniably\\r\\nmy own handwriting. Have I written the tragedy? Wonderful, very\\r\\nwonderful!--And this--what have I here? 'INTRIGUE ON THE RAMPARTS; or\\r\\nTHE DAY OF REPENTANCE: vaudeville with new songs to the most favorite\\r\\nairs.' The deuce! Where did I get all this rubbish? Some one must have\\r\\nslipped it slyly into my pocket for a joke. There is too a letter to me;\\r\\na crumpled letter and the seal broken.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYes; it was not a very polite epistle from the manager of a theatre, in\\r\\nwhich both pieces were flatly refused.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hem! hem!” said the clerk breathlessly, and quite exhausted he seated\\r\\nhimself on a bank. His thoughts were so elastic, his heart so tender;\\r\\nand involuntarily he picked one of the nearest flowers. It is a simple\\r\\ndaisy, just bursting out of the bud. What the botanist tells us after\\r\\na number of imperfect lectures, the flower proclaimed in a minute. It\\r\\nrelated the mythus of its birth, told of the power of the sun-light that\\r\\nspread out its delicate leaves, and forced them to impregnate the air\\r\\nwith their incense--and then he thought of the manifold struggles of\\r\\nlife, which in like manner awaken the budding flowers of feeling in our\\r\\nbosom. Light and air contend with chivalric emulation for the love of\\r\\nthe fair flower that bestowed her chief favors on the latter; full of\\r\\nlonging she turned towards the light, and as soon as it vanished, rolled\\r\\nher tender leaves together and slept in the embraces of the air. “It is\\r\\nthe light which adorns me,” said the flower.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But 'tis the air which enables thee to breathe,” said the poet's voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nClose by stood a boy who dashed his stick into a wet ditch. The drops of\\r\\nwater splashed up to the green leafy roof, and the clerk thought of the\\r\\nmillion of ephemera which in a single drop were thrown up to a height,\\r\\nthat was as great doubtless for their size, as for us if we were to\\r\\nbe hurled above the clouds. While he thought of this and of the whole\\r\\nmetamorphosis he had undergone, he smiled and said, “I sleep and dream;\\r\\nbut it is wonderful how one can dream so naturally, and know besides so\\r\\nexactly that it is but a dream. If only to-morrow on awaking, I could\\r\\nagain call all to mind so vividly! I seem in unusually good spirits; my\\r\\nperception of things is clear, I feel as light and cheerful as though\\r\\nI were in heaven; but I know for a certainty, that if to-morrow a dim\\r\\nremembrance of it should swim before my mind, it will then seem nothing\\r\\nbut stupid nonsense, as I have often experienced already--especially\\r\\nbefore I enlisted under the banner of the police, for that dispels like\\r\\na whirlwind all the visions of an unfettered imagination. All we hear\\r\\nor say in a dream that is fair and beautiful is like the gold of the\\r\\nsubterranean spirits; it is rich and splendid when it is given us, but\\r\\nviewed by daylight we find only withered leaves. Alas!” he sighed quite\\r\\nsorrowful, and gazed at the chirping birds that hopped contentedly from\\r\\nbranch to branch, “they are much better off than I! To fly must be a\\r\\nheavenly art; and happy do I prize that creature in which it is innate.\\r\\nYes! Could I exchange my nature with any other creature, I fain would be\\r\\nsuch a happy little lark!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly uttered these hasty words when the skirts and sleeves\\r\\nof his coat folded themselves together into wings; the clothes became\\r\\nfeathers, and the galoshes claws. He observed it perfectly, and laughed\\r\\nin his heart. “Now then, there is no doubt that I am dreaming; but I\\r\\nnever before was aware of such mad freaks as these.” And up he flew into\\r\\nthe green roof and sang; but in the song there was no poetry, for the\\r\\nspirit of the poet was gone. The Shoes, as is the case with anybody who\\r\\ndoes what he has to do properly, could only attend to one thing at a\\r\\ntime. He wanted to be a poet, and he was one; he now wished to be a\\r\\nmerry chirping bird: but when he was metamorphosed into one, the former\\r\\npeculiarities ceased immediately. “It is really pleasant enough,” said\\r\\nhe: “the whole day long I sit in the office amid the driest\\r\\nlaw-papers, and at night I fly in my dream as a lark in the gardens of\\r\\nFredericksburg; one might really write a very pretty comedy upon it.” He\\r\\nnow fluttered down into the grass, turned his head gracefully on every\\r\\nside, and with his bill pecked the pliant blades of grass, which, in\\r\\ncomparison to his present size, seemed as majestic as the palm-branches\\r\\nof northern Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately the pleasure lasted but a moment. Presently black night\\r\\novershadowed our enthusiast, who had so entirely missed his part of\\r\\ncopying-clerk at a police-office; some vast object seemed to be thrown\\r\\nover him. It was a large oil-skin cap, which a sailor-boy of the quay\\r\\nhad thrown over the struggling bird; a coarse hand sought its way\\r\\ncarefully in under the broad rim, and seized the clerk over the back\\r\\nand wings. In the first moment of fear, he called, indeed, as loud as\\r\\nhe could--“You impudent little blackguard! I am a copying-clerk at\\r\\nthe police-office; and you know you cannot insult any belonging to the\\r\\nconstabulary force without a chastisement. Besides, you good-for-nothing\\r\\nrascal, it is strictly forbidden to catch birds in the royal gardens of\\r\\nFredericksburg; but your blue uniform betrays where you come from.”\\r\\n This fine tirade sounded, however, to the ungodly sailor-boy like a mere\\r\\n“Pippi-pi.” He gave the noisy bird a knock on his beak, and walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was soon met by two schoolboys of the upper class--that is to say as\\r\\nindividuals, for with regard to learning they were in the lowest class\\r\\nin the school; and they bought the stupid bird. So the copying-clerk\\r\\ncame to Copenhagen as guest, or rather as prisoner in a family living in\\r\\nGother Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis well that I'm dreaming,” said the clerk, “or I really should get\\r\\nangry. First I was a poet; now sold for a few pence as a lark; no doubt\\r\\nit was that accursed poetical nature which has metamorphosed me\\r\\ninto such a poor harmless little creature. It is really pitiable,\\r\\nparticularly when one gets into the hands of a little blackguard,\\r\\nperfect in all sorts of cruelty to animals: all I should like to know\\r\\nis, how the story will end.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two schoolboys, the proprietors now of the transformed clerk,\\r\\ncarried him into an elegant room. A stout stately dame received them\\r\\nwith a smile; but she expressed much dissatisfaction that a common\\r\\nfield-bird, as she called the lark, should appear in such high society.\\r\\nFor to-day, however, she would allow it; and they must shut him in the\\r\\nempty cage that was standing in the window. “Perhaps he will amuse my\\r\\ngood Polly,” added the lady, looking with a benignant smile at a large\\r\\ngreen parrot that swung himself backwards and forwards most comfortably\\r\\nin his ring, inside a magnificent brass-wired cage. “To-day is Polly's\\r\\nbirthday,” said she with stupid simplicity: “and the little brown\\r\\nfield-bird must wish him joy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Polly uttered not a syllable in reply, but swung to and fro with\\r\\ndignified condescension; while a pretty canary, as yellow as gold, that\\r\\nhad lately been brought from his sunny fragrant home, began to sing\\r\\naloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Noisy creature! Will you be quiet!” screamed the lady of the house,\\r\\ncovering the cage with an embroidered white pocket handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Chirp, chirp!” sighed he. “That was a dreadful snowstorm”; and he\\r\\nsighed again, and was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe copying-clerk, or, as the lady said, the brown field-bird, was\\r\\nput into a small cage, close to the Canary, and not far from “my good\\r\\nPolly.” The only human sounds that the Parrot could bawl out\\r\\nwere, “Come, let us be men!” Everything else that he said was as\\r\\nunintelligible to everybody as the chirping of the Canary, except to the\\r\\nclerk, who was now a bird too: he understood his companion perfectly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I flew about beneath the green palms and the blossoming almond-trees,”\\r\\n sang the Canary; “I flew around, with my brothers and sisters, over\\r\\nthe beautiful flowers, and over the glassy lakes, where the bright\\r\\nwater-plants nodded to me from below. There, too, I saw many\\r\\nsplendidly-dressed paroquets, that told the drollest stories, and the\\r\\nwildest fairy tales without end.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! those were uncouth birds,” answered the Parrot. “They had no\\r\\neducation, and talked of whatever came into their head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If my mistress and all her friends can laugh at what I say, so may you\\r\\ntoo, I should think. It is a great fault to have no taste for what is\\r\\nwitty or amusing--come, let us be men.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you have no remembrance of love for the charming maidens that\\r\\ndanced beneath the outspread tents beside the bright fragrant flowers?\\r\\nDo you no longer remember the sweet fruits, and the cooling juice in\\r\\nthe wild plants of our never-to-be-forgotten home?” said the former\\r\\ninhabitant of the Canary Isles, continuing his dithyrambic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes,” said the Parrot; “but I am far better off here. I am well\\r\\nfed, and get friendly treatment. I know I am a clever fellow; and that\\r\\nis all I care about. Come, let us be men. You are of a poetical nature,\\r\\nas it is called--I, on the contrary, possess profound knowledge and\\r\\ninexhaustible wit. You have genius; but clear-sighted, calm discretion\\r\\ndoes not take such lofty flights, and utter such high natural tones.\\r\\nFor this they have covered you over--they never do the like to me; for\\r\\nI cost more. Besides, they are afraid of my beak; and I have always a\\r\\nwitty answer at hand. Come, let us be men!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“O warm spicy land of my birth,” sang the Canary bird; “I will sing of\\r\\nthy dark-green bowers, of the calm bays where the pendent boughs\\r\\nkiss the surface of the water; I will sing of the rejoicing of all my\\r\\nbrothers and sisters where the cactus grows in wanton luxuriance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Spare us your elegiac tones,” said the Parrot giggling. “Rather speak\\r\\nof something at which one may laugh heartily. Laughing is an infallible\\r\\nsign of the highest degree of mental development. Can a dog, or a horse\\r\\nlaugh? No, but they can cry. The gift of laughing was given to man\\r\\nalone. Ha! ha! ha!” screamed Polly, and added his stereotype witticism.\\r\\n“Come, let us be men!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor little Danish grey-bird,” said the Canary; “you have been caught\\r\\ntoo. It is, no doubt, cold enough in your woods, but there at least\\r\\nis the breath of liberty; therefore fly away. In the hurry they have\\r\\nforgotten to shut your cage, and the upper window is open. Fly, my\\r\\nfriend; fly away. Farewell!”\\r\\n\\r\\nInstinctively the Clerk obeyed; with a few strokes of his wings he was\\r\\nout of the cage; but at the same moment the door, which was only ajar,\\r\\nand which led to the next room, began to creak, and supple and creeping\\r\\ncame the large tomcat into the room, and began to pursue him. The\\r\\nfrightened Canary fluttered about in his cage; the Parrot flapped his\\r\\nwings, and cried, “Come, let us be men!” The Clerk felt a mortal fright,\\r\\nand flew through the window, far away over the houses and streets. At\\r\\nlast he was forced to rest a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighboring house had a something familiar about it; a window stood\\r\\nopen; he flew in; it was his own room. He perched upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, let us be men!” said he, involuntarily imitating the chatter of\\r\\nthe Parrot, and at the same moment he was again a copying-clerk; but he\\r\\nwas sitting in the middle of the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Heaven help me!” cried he. “How did I get up here--and so buried in\\r\\nsleep, too? After all, that was a very unpleasant, disagreeable dream\\r\\nthat haunted me! The whole story is nothing but silly, stupid nonsense!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI. The Best That the Galoshes Gave\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day, early in the morning, while the Clerk was still in\\r\\nbed, someone knocked at his door. It was his neighbor, a young Divine,\\r\\nwho lived on the same floor. He walked in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lend me your Galoshes,” said he; “it is so wet in the garden, though\\r\\nthe sun is shining most invitingly. I should like to go out a little.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got the Galoshes, and he was soon below in a little duodecimo garden,\\r\\nwhere between two immense walls a plumtree and an apple-tree were\\r\\nstanding. Even such a little garden as this was considered in the\\r\\nmetropolis of Copenhagen as a great luxury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man wandered up and down the narrow paths, as well as the\\r\\nprescribed limits would allow; the clock struck six; without was heard\\r\\nthe horn of a post-boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To travel! to travel!” exclaimed he, overcome by most painful and\\r\\npassionate remembrances. “That is the happiest thing in the world! That\\r\\nis the highest aim of all my wishes! Then at last would the agonizing\\r\\nrestlessness be allayed, which destroys my existence! But it must be\\r\\nfar, far away! I would behold magnificent Switzerland; I would travel to\\r\\nItaly, and--”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a good thing that the power of the Galoshes worked as\\r\\ninstantaneously as lightning in a powder-magazine would do, otherwise\\r\\nthe poor man with his overstrained wishes would have travelled about\\r\\nthe world too much for himself as well as for us. In short, he was\\r\\ntravelling. He was in the middle of Switzerland, but packed up with\\r\\neight other passengers in the inside of an eternally-creaking diligence;\\r\\nhis head ached till it almost split, his weary neck could hardly bear\\r\\nthe heavy load, and his feet, pinched by his torturing boots, were\\r\\nterribly swollen. He was in an intermediate state between sleeping and\\r\\nwaking; at variance with himself, with his company, with the country,\\r\\nand with the government. In his right pocket he had his letter of\\r\\ncredit, in the left, his passport, and in a small leathern purse some\\r\\ndouble louis d'or, carefully sewn up in the bosom of his waistcoat.\\r\\nEvery dream proclaimed that one or the other of these valuables was\\r\\nlost; wherefore he started up as in a fever; and the first movement\\r\\nwhich his hand made, described a magic triangle from the right pocket to\\r\\nthe left, and then up towards the bosom, to feel if he had them all safe\\r\\nor not. From the roof inside the carriage, umbrellas, walking-sticks,\\r\\nhats, and sundry other articles were depending, and hindered the view,\\r\\nwhich was particularly imposing. He now endeavored as well as he\\r\\nwas able to dispel his gloom, which was caused by outward chance\\r\\ncircumstances merely, and on the bosom of nature imbibe the milk of\\r\\npurest human enjoyment.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand, solemn, and dark was the whole landscape around. The gigantic\\r\\npine-forests, on the pointed crags, seemed almost like little tufts of\\r\\nheather, colored by the surrounding clouds. It began to snow, a cold\\r\\nwind blew and roared as though it were seeking a bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Augh!” sighed he, “were we only on the other side the Alps, then we\\r\\nshould have summer, and I could get my letters of credit cashed. The\\r\\nanxiety I feel about them prevents me enjoying Switzerland. Were I but\\r\\non the other side!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying he was on the other side in Italy, between Florence and\\r\\nRome. Lake Thracymene, illumined by the evening sun, lay like flaming\\r\\ngold between the dark-blue mountain-ridges; here, where Hannibal\\r\\ndefeated Flaminius, the rivers now held each other in their green\\r\\nembraces; lovely, half-naked children tended a herd of black swine,\\r\\nbeneath a group of fragrant laurel-trees, hard by the road-side.\\r\\nCould we render this inimitable picture properly, then would everybody\\r\\nexclaim, “Beautiful, unparalleled Italy!” But neither the young Divine\\r\\nsaid so, nor anyone of his grumbling companions in the coach of the\\r\\nvetturino.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poisonous flies and gnats swarmed around by thousands; in vain one\\r\\nwaved myrtle-branches about like mad; the audacious insect population\\r\\ndid not cease to sting; nor was there a single person in the\\r\\nwell-crammed carriage whose face was not swollen and sore from their\\r\\nravenous bites. The poor horses, tortured almost to death, suffered most\\r\\nfrom this truly Egyptian plague; the flies alighted upon them in large\\r\\ndisgusting swarms; and if the coachman got down and scraped them off,\\r\\nhardly a minute elapsed before they were there again. The sun now set: a\\r\\nfreezing cold, though of short duration pervaded the whole creation;\\r\\nit was like a horrid gust coming from a burial-vault on a warm summer's\\r\\nday--but all around the mountains retained that wonderful green tone\\r\\nwhich we see in some old pictures, and which, should we not have seen a\\r\\nsimilar play of color in the South, we declare at once to be unnatural.\\r\\nIt was a glorious prospect; but the stomach was empty, the body tired;\\r\\nall that the heart cared and longed for was good night-quarters; yet\\r\\nhow would they be? For these one looked much more anxiously than for the\\r\\ncharms of nature, which every where were so profusely displayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road led through an olive-grove, and here the solitary inn was\\r\\nsituated. Ten or twelve crippled-beggars had encamped outside. The\\r\\nhealthiest of them resembled, to use an expression of Marryat's,\\r\\n“Hunger's eldest son when he had come of age”; the others were either\\r\\nblind, had withered legs and crept about on their hands, or withered\\r\\narms and fingerless hands. It was the most wretched misery, dragged\\r\\nfrom among the filthiest rags. “Excellenza, miserabili!” sighed they,\\r\\nthrusting forth their deformed limbs to view. Even the hostess, with\\r\\nbare feet, uncombed hair, and dressed in a garment of doubtful color,\\r\\nreceived the guests grumblingly. The doors were fastened with a loop of\\r\\nstring; the floor of the rooms presented a stone paving half torn\\r\\nup; bats fluttered wildly about the ceiling; and as to the smell\\r\\ntherein--no--that was beyond description.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better lay the cloth below in the stable,” said one of the\\r\\ntravellers; “there, at all events, one knows what one is breathing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe windows were quickly opened, to let in a little fresh air. Quicker,\\r\\nhowever, than the breeze, the withered, sallow arms of the beggars were\\r\\nthrust in, accompanied by the eternal whine of “Miserabili, miserabili,\\r\\nexcellenza!” On the walls were displayed innumerable inscriptions,\\r\\nwritten in nearly every language of Europe, some in verse, some in\\r\\nprose, most of them not very laudatory of “bella Italia.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meal was served. It consisted of a soup of salted water, seasoned\\r\\nwith pepper and rancid oil. The last ingredient played a very prominent\\r\\npart in the salad; stale eggs and roasted cocks'-combs furnished the\\r\\ngrand dish of the repast; the wine even was not without a disgusting\\r\\ntaste--it was like a medicinal draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night the boxes and other effects of the passengers were placed\\r\\nagainst the rickety doors. One of the travellers kept watch while the\\r\\nothers slept. The sentry was our young Divine. How close it was in the\\r\\nchamber! The heat oppressive to suffocation--the gnats hummed and stung\\r\\nunceasingly--the “miserabili” without whined and moaned in their sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Travelling would be agreeable enough,” said he groaning, “if one only\\r\\nhad no body, or could send it to rest while the spirit went on its\\r\\npilgrimage unhindered, whither the voice within might call it. Wherever\\r\\nI go, I am pursued by a longing that is insatiable--that I cannot\\r\\nexplain to myself, and that tears my very heart. I want something better\\r\\nthan what is but what is fled in an instant. But what is it, and where\\r\\nis it to be found? Yet, I know in reality what it is I wish for. Oh!\\r\\nmost happy were I, could I but reach one aim--could but reach the\\r\\nhappiest of all!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as he spoke the word he was again in his home; the long white\\r\\ncurtains hung down from the windows, and in the middle of the floor\\r\\nstood the black coffin; in it he lay in the sleep of death. His wish\\r\\nwas fulfilled--the body rested, while the spirit went unhindered on its\\r\\npilgrimage. “Let no one deem himself happy before his end,” were the\\r\\nwords of Solon; and here was a new and brilliant proof of the wisdom of\\r\\nthe old apothegm.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery corpse is a sphynx of immortality; here too on the black coffin\\r\\nthe sphynx gave us no answer to what he who lay within had written two\\r\\ndays before:\\r\\n\\r\\n     “O mighty Death! thy silence teaches nought,\\r\\n       Thou leadest only to the near grave's brink;\\r\\n      Is broken now the ladder of my thoughts?\\r\\n     Do I instead of mounting only sink?\\r\\n\\r\\n     Our heaviest grief the world oft seeth not,\\r\\n      Our sorest pain we hide from stranger eyes:\\r\\n      And for the sufferer there is nothing left\\r\\n     But the green mound that o'er the coffin lies.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo figures were moving in the chamber. We knew them both; it was the\\r\\nfairy of Care, and the emissary of Fortune. They both bent over the\\r\\ncorpse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you now see,” said Care, “what happiness your Galoshes have brought\\r\\nto mankind?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To him, at least, who slumbers here, they have brought an imperishable\\r\\nblessing,” answered the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah no!” replied Care. “He took his departure himself; he was not called\\r\\naway. His mental powers here below were not strong enough to reach the\\r\\ntreasures lying beyond this life, and which his destiny ordained he\\r\\nshould obtain. I will now confer a benefit on him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she took the Galoshes from his feet; his sleep of death was ended;\\r\\nand he who had been thus called back again to life arose from his\\r\\ndread couch in all the vigor of youth. Care vanished, and with her the\\r\\nGaloshes. She has no doubt taken them for herself, to keep them to all\\r\\neternity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIR TREE\\r\\n\\r\\nOut in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree. The place he had was a\\r\\nvery good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air, there was enough\\r\\nof that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as\\r\\nfirs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not care\\r\\nfor the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they\\r\\nwere in the woods looking for wild-strawberries. The children often came\\r\\nwith a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of them threaded on\\r\\na straw, and sat down near the young tree and said, “Oh, how pretty he\\r\\nis! What a nice little fir!” But this was what the Tree could not bear\\r\\nto hear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year\\r\\nhe was another long bit taller; for with fir trees one can always tell\\r\\nby the shoots how many years old they are.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! Were I but such a high tree as the others are,” sighed he. “Then I\\r\\nshould be able to spread out my branches, and with the tops to look into\\r\\nthe wide world! Then would the birds build nests among my branches: and\\r\\nwhen there was a breeze, I could bend with as much stateliness as the\\r\\nothers!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds which morning\\r\\nand evening sailed above him, gave the little Tree any pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare would\\r\\noften come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree. Oh, that\\r\\nmade him so angry! But two winters were past, and in the third the Tree\\r\\nwas so large that the hare was obliged to go round it. “To grow and\\r\\ngrow, to get older and be tall,” thought the Tree--“that, after all, is\\r\\nthe most delightful thing in the world!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest\\r\\ntrees. This happened every year; and the young Fir Tree, that had now\\r\\ngrown to a very comely size, trembled at the sight; for the magnificent\\r\\ngreat trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were\\r\\nlopped off, and the trees looked long and bare; they were hardly to be\\r\\nrecognised; and then they were laid in carts, and the horses dragged\\r\\nthem out of the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere did they go to? What became of them?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spring, when the swallows and the storks came, the Tree asked them,\\r\\n“Don't you know where they have been taken? Have you not met them\\r\\nanywhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe swallows did not know anything about it; but the Stork looked\\r\\nmusing, nodded his head, and said, “Yes; I think I know; I met many\\r\\nships as I was flying hither from Egypt; on the ships were magnificent\\r\\nmasts, and I venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir.\\r\\nI may congratulate you, for they lifted themselves on high most\\r\\nmajestically!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, were I but old enough to fly across the sea! But how does the sea\\r\\nlook in reality? What is it like?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That would take a long time to explain,” said the Stork, and with these\\r\\nwords off he went.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rejoice in thy growth!” said the Sunbeams. “Rejoice in thy vigorous\\r\\ngrowth, and in the fresh life that moveth within thee!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears over him; but the\\r\\nFir understood it not.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Christmas came, quite young trees were cut down: trees which often\\r\\nwere not even as large or of the same age as this Fir Tree, who could\\r\\nnever rest, but always wanted to be off. These young trees, and they\\r\\nwere always the finest looking, retained their branches; they were laid\\r\\non carts, and the horses drew them out of the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are they going to?” asked the Fir. “They are not taller than\\r\\nI; there was one indeed that was considerably shorter; and why do they\\r\\nretain all their branches? Whither are they taken?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We know! We know!” chirped the Sparrows. “We have peeped in at the\\r\\nwindows in the town below! We know whither they are taken! The greatest\\r\\nsplendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them. We\\r\\npeeped through the windows, and saw them planted in the middle of the\\r\\nwarm room and ornamented with the most splendid things, with gilded\\r\\napples, with gingerbread, with toys, and many hundred lights!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And then?” asked the Fir Tree, trembling in every bough. “And then?\\r\\nWhat happens then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career,” cried\\r\\nthe Tree, rejoicing. “That is still better than to cross the sea! What\\r\\na longing do I suffer! Were Christmas but come! I am now tall, and my\\r\\nbranches spread like the others that were carried off last year! Oh!\\r\\nwere I but already on the cart! Were I in the warm room with all the\\r\\nsplendor and magnificence! Yes; then something better, something still\\r\\ngrander, will surely follow, or wherefore should they thus ornament me?\\r\\nSomething better, something still grander must follow--but what? Oh, how\\r\\nI long, how I suffer! I do not know myself what is the matter with me!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rejoice in our presence!” said the Air and the Sunlight. “Rejoice in\\r\\nthy own fresh youth!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green\\r\\nboth winter and summer. People that saw him said, “What a fine tree!”\\r\\n and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe\\r\\nstruck deep into the very pith; the Tree fell to the earth with a sigh;\\r\\nhe felt a pang--it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness,\\r\\nfor he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place\\r\\nwhere he had sprung up. He well knew that he should never see his dear\\r\\nold comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, anymore; perhaps\\r\\nnot even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court-yard with\\r\\nthe other trees, and heard a man say, “That one is splendid! We don't\\r\\nwant the others.” Then two servants came in rich livery and carried the\\r\\nFir Tree into a large and splendid drawing-room. Portraits were hanging\\r\\non the walls, and near the white porcelain stove stood two large Chinese\\r\\nvases with lions on the covers. There, too, were large easy-chairs,\\r\\nsilken sofas, large tables full of picture-books and full of toys, worth\\r\\nhundreds and hundreds of crowns--at least the children said so. And the\\r\\nFir Tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand; but no\\r\\none could see that it was a cask, for green cloth was hung all round it,\\r\\nand it stood on a large gaily-colored carpet. Oh! how the Tree quivered!\\r\\nWhat was to happen? The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated\\r\\nit. On one branch there hung little nets cut out of colored paper, and\\r\\neach net was filled with sugarplums; and among the other boughs gilded\\r\\napples and walnuts were suspended, looking as though they had grown\\r\\nthere, and little blue and white tapers were placed among the leaves.\\r\\nDolls that looked for all the world like men--the Tree had never beheld\\r\\nsuch before--were seen among the foliage, and at the very top a\\r\\nlarge star of gold tinsel was fixed. It was really splendid--beyond\\r\\ndescription splendid.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This evening!” they all said. “How it will shine this evening!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” thought the Tree. “If the evening were but come! If the tapers\\r\\nwere but lighted! And then I wonder what will happen! Perhaps the other\\r\\ntrees from the forest will come to look at me! Perhaps the sparrows will\\r\\nbeat against the windowpanes! I wonder if I shall take root here, and\\r\\nwinter and summer stand covered with ornaments!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew very much about the matter--but he was so impatient that for\\r\\nsheer longing he got a pain in his back, and this with trees is the same\\r\\nthing as a headache with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe candles were now lighted--what brightness! What splendor! The\\r\\nTree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the\\r\\nfoliage. It blazed up famously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Help! Help!” cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Tree did not even dare tremble. What a state he was in! He was\\r\\nso uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor, that he was\\r\\nquite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness; when suddenly both\\r\\nfolding-doors opened and a troop of children rushed in as if they would\\r\\nupset the Tree. The older persons followed quietly; the little ones\\r\\nstood quite still. But it was only for a moment; then they shouted that\\r\\nthe whole place re-echoed with their rejoicing; they danced round the\\r\\nTree, and one present after the other was pulled off.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are they about?” thought the Tree. “What is to happen now!” And\\r\\nthe lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned down\\r\\nthey were put out one after the other, and then the children had\\r\\npermission to plunder the Tree. So they fell upon it with such violence\\r\\nthat all its branches cracked; if it had not been fixed firmly in the\\r\\nground, it would certainly have tumbled down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children danced about with their beautiful playthings; no one looked\\r\\nat the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between the branches; but\\r\\nit was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been\\r\\nforgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A story! A story!” cried the children, drawing a little fat man towards\\r\\nthe Tree. He seated himself under it and said, “Now we are in the shade,\\r\\nand the Tree can listen too. But I shall tell only one story. Now which\\r\\nwill you have; that about Ivedy-Avedy, or about Humpy-Dumpy, who\\r\\ntumbled downstairs, and yet after all came to the throne and married the\\r\\nprincess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ivedy-Avedy,” cried some; “Humpy-Dumpy,” cried the others. There was\\r\\nsuch a bawling and screaming--the Fir Tree alone was silent, and he\\r\\nthought to himself, “Am I not to bawl with the rest? Am I to do nothing\\r\\nwhatever?” for he was one of the company, and had done what he had to\\r\\ndo.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the man told about Humpy-Dumpy that tumbled down, who\\r\\nnotwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the princess.\\r\\nAnd the children clapped their hands, and cried. “Oh, go on! Do go on!”\\r\\n They wanted to hear about Ivedy-Avedy too, but the little man only told\\r\\nthem about Humpy-Dumpy. The Fir Tree stood quite still and absorbed\\r\\nin thought; the birds in the wood had never related the like of this.\\r\\n“Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess! Yes, yes!\\r\\nThat's the way of the world!” thought the Fir Tree, and believed it all,\\r\\nbecause the man who told the story was so good-looking. “Well, well! who\\r\\nknows, perhaps I may fall downstairs, too, and get a princess as wife!”\\r\\n And he looked forward with joy to the morrow, when he hoped to be decked\\r\\nout again with lights, playthings, fruits, and tinsel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won't tremble to-morrow!” thought the Fir Tree. “I will enjoy to\\r\\nthe full all my splendor! To-morrow I shall hear again the story of\\r\\nHumpy-Dumpy, and perhaps that of Ivedy-Avedy too.” And the whole night\\r\\nthe Tree stood still and in deep thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now then the splendor will begin again,” thought the Fir. But they\\r\\ndragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft: and here,\\r\\nin a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him. “What's\\r\\nthe meaning of this?” thought the Tree. “What am I to do here? What\\r\\nshall I hear now, I wonder?” And he leaned against the wall lost in\\r\\nreverie. Time enough had he too for his reflections; for days and nights\\r\\npassed on, and nobody came up; and when at last somebody did come, it\\r\\nwas only to put some great trunks in a corner, out of the way. There\\r\\nstood the Tree quite hidden; it seemed as if he had been entirely\\r\\nforgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis now winter out-of-doors!” thought the Tree. “The earth is hard and\\r\\ncovered with snow; men cannot plant me now, and therefore I have been\\r\\nput up here under shelter till the spring-time comes! How thoughtful\\r\\nthat is! How kind man is, after all! If it only were not so dark here,\\r\\nand so terribly lonely! Not even a hare! And out in the woods it was\\r\\nso pleasant, when the snow was on the ground, and the hare leaped by;\\r\\nyes--even when he jumped over me; but I did not like it then! It is\\r\\nreally terribly lonely here!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Squeak! Squeak!” said a little Mouse, at the same moment, peeping out\\r\\nof his hole. And then another little one came. They snuffed about the\\r\\nFir Tree, and rustled among the branches.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is dreadfully cold,” said the Mouse. “But for that, it would be\\r\\ndelightful here, old Fir, wouldn't it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am by no means old,” said the Fir Tree. “There's many a one\\r\\nconsiderably older than I am.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where do you come from,” asked the Mice; “and what can you do?” They\\r\\nwere so extremely curious. “Tell us about the most beautiful spot on the\\r\\nearth. Have you never been there? Were you never in the larder, where\\r\\ncheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from above; where one dances\\r\\nabout on tallow candles: that place where one enters lean, and comes out\\r\\nagain fat and portly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know no such place,” said the Tree. “But I know the wood, where the\\r\\nsun shines and where the little birds sing.” And then he told all about\\r\\nhis youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before; and they\\r\\nlistened and said,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, to be sure! How much you have seen! How happy you must have\\r\\nbeen!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I!” said the Fir Tree, thinking over what he had himself related.\\r\\n“Yes, in reality those were happy times.” And then he told about\\r\\nChristmas-eve, when he was decked out with cakes and candles.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” said the little Mice, “how fortunate you have been, old Fir Tree!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am by no means old,” said he. “I came from the wood this winter; I am\\r\\nin my prime, and am only rather short for my age.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What delightful stories you know,” said the Mice: and the next night\\r\\nthey came with four other little Mice, who were to hear what the Tree\\r\\nrecounted: and the more he related, the more he remembered himself; and\\r\\nit appeared as if those times had really been happy times. “But they may\\r\\nstill come--they may still come! Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet\\r\\nhe got a princess!” and he thought at the moment of a nice little Birch\\r\\nTree growing out in the woods: to the Fir, that would be a real charming\\r\\nprincess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is Humpy-Dumpy?” asked the Mice. So then the Fir Tree told the\\r\\nwhole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it; and the\\r\\nlittle Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree. Next night\\r\\ntwo more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats even; but they said the\\r\\nstories were not interesting, which vexed the little Mice; and they,\\r\\ntoo, now began to think them not so very amusing either.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know only one story?” asked the Rats.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only that one,” answered the Tree. “I heard it on my happiest evening;\\r\\nbut I did not then know how happy I was.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a very stupid story! Don't you know one about bacon and tallow\\r\\ncandles? Can't you tell any larder stories?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said the Tree.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then good-bye,” said the Rats; and they went home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: “After\\r\\nall, it was very pleasant when the sleek little Mice sat round me, and\\r\\nlistened to what I told them. Now that too is over. But I will take good\\r\\ncare to enjoy myself when I am brought out again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when was that to be? Why, one morning there came a quantity of\\r\\npeople and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved, the tree was\\r\\npulled out and thrown--rather hard, it is true--down on the floor, but a\\r\\nman drew him towards the stairs, where the daylight shone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now a merry life will begin again,” thought the Tree. He felt the fresh\\r\\nair, the first sunbeam--and now he was out in the courtyard. All passed\\r\\nso quickly, there was so much going on around him, the Tree quite forgot\\r\\nto look to himself. The court adjoined a garden, and all was in flower;\\r\\nthe roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade, the lindens\\r\\nwere in blossom, the Swallows flew by, and said, “Quirre-vit! My husband\\r\\nis come!” but it was not the Fir Tree that they meant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, then, I shall really enjoy life,” said he exultingly, and spread\\r\\nout his branches; but, alas, they were all withered and yellow! It was\\r\\nin a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles. The golden star of\\r\\ntinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in the sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the court-yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced\\r\\nat Christmas round the Fir Tree, and were so glad at the sight of him.\\r\\nOne of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only look what is still on the ugly old Christmas tree!” said he,\\r\\ntrampling on the branches, so that they all cracked beneath his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness in\\r\\nthe garden; he beheld himself, and wished he had remained in his dark\\r\\ncorner in the loft; he thought of his first youth in the wood, of the\\r\\nmerry Christmas-eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with so\\r\\nmuch pleasure to the story of Humpy-Dumpy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis over--'tis past!” said the poor Tree. “Had I but rejoiced when I\\r\\nhad reason to do so! But now 'tis past, 'tis past!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was a\\r\\nwhole heap lying there. The wood flamed up splendidly under the large\\r\\nbrewing copper, and it sighed so deeply! Each sigh was like a shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold star\\r\\non his breast which the Tree had had on the happiest evening of his\\r\\nlife. However, that was over now--the Tree gone, the story at an end.\\r\\nAll, all was over--every tale must end at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SNOW QUEEN\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST STORY. Which Treats of a Mirror and of the Splinters\\r\\n\\r\\nNow then, let us begin. When we are at the end of the story, we shall\\r\\nknow more than we know now: but to begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a wicked sprite, indeed he was the most\\r\\nmischievous of all sprites. One day he was in a very good humor, for\\r\\nhe had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and\\r\\nbeautiful when it was reflected therein, to look poor and mean; but\\r\\nthat which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified\\r\\nand increased in ugliness. In this mirror the most beautiful landscapes\\r\\nlooked like boiled spinach, and the best persons were turned into\\r\\nfrights, or appeared to stand on their heads; their faces were so\\r\\ndistorted that they were not to be recognised; and if anyone had a mole,\\r\\nyou might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose\\r\\nand mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That's glorious fun!” said the sprite. If a good thought passed through\\r\\na man's mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and the sprite laughed\\r\\nheartily at his clever discovery. All the little sprites who went to his\\r\\nschool--for he kept a sprite school--told each other that a miracle had\\r\\nhappened; and that now only, as they thought, it would be possible to\\r\\nsee how the world really looked. They ran about with the mirror; and at\\r\\nlast there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted\\r\\nin the mirror. So then they thought they would fly up to the sky,\\r\\nand have a joke there. The higher they flew with the mirror, the more\\r\\nterribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast. Higher and higher\\r\\nstill they flew, nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly the\\r\\nmirror shook so terribly with grinning, that it flew out of their hands\\r\\nand fell to the earth, where it was dashed in a hundred million and more\\r\\npieces. And now it worked much more evil than before; for some of these\\r\\npieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they flew about in\\r\\nthe wide world, and when they got into people's eyes, there they stayed;\\r\\nand then people saw everything perverted, or only had an eye for that\\r\\nwhich was evil. This happened because the very smallest bit had the\\r\\nsame power which the whole mirror had possessed. Some persons even got\\r\\na splinter in their heart, and then it made one shudder, for their heart\\r\\nbecame like a lump of ice. Some of the broken pieces were so large that\\r\\nthey were used for windowpanes, through which one could not see one's\\r\\nfriends. Other pieces were put in spectacles; and that was a sad affair\\r\\nwhen people put on their glasses to see well and rightly. Then the\\r\\nwicked sprite laughed till he almost choked, for all this tickled his\\r\\nfancy. The fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall\\r\\nhear what happened next.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND STORY. A Little Boy and a Little Girl\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a large town, where there are so many houses, and so many people,\\r\\nthat there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden; and\\r\\nwhere, on this account, most persons are obliged to content themselves\\r\\nwith flowers in pots; there lived two little children, who had a garden\\r\\nsomewhat larger than a flower-pot. They were not brother and sister; but\\r\\nthey cared for each other as much as if they were. Their parents lived\\r\\nexactly opposite. They inhabited two garrets; and where the roof of the\\r\\none house joined that of the other, and the gutter ran along the extreme\\r\\nend of it, there was to each house a small window: one needed only to\\r\\nstep over the gutter to get from one window to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children's parents had large wooden boxes there, in which vegetables\\r\\nfor the kitchen were planted, and little rosetrees besides: there was a\\r\\nrose in each box, and they grew splendidly. They now thought of placing\\r\\nthe boxes across the gutter, so that they nearly reached from one window\\r\\nto the other, and looked just like two walls of flowers. The tendrils\\r\\nof the peas hung down over the boxes; and the rose-trees shot up long\\r\\nbranches, twined round the windows, and then bent towards each other: it\\r\\nwas almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers. The boxes were\\r\\nvery high, and the children knew that they must not creep over them; so\\r\\nthey often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other,\\r\\nand to sit on their little stools among the roses, where they could play\\r\\ndelightfully. In winter there was an end of this pleasure. The windows\\r\\nwere often frozen over; but then they heated copper farthings on the\\r\\nstove, and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane, and then they had a\\r\\ncapital peep-hole, quite nicely rounded; and out of each peeped a gentle\\r\\nfriendly eye--it was the little boy and the little girl who were looking\\r\\nout. His name was Kay, hers was Gerda. In summer, with one jump, they\\r\\ncould get to each other; but in winter they were obliged first to\\r\\ngo down the long stairs, and then up the long stairs again: and\\r\\nout-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is the white bees that are swarming,” said Kay's old grandmother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do the white bees choose a queen?” asked the little boy; for he knew\\r\\nthat the honey-bees always have one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said the grandmother, “she flies where the swarm hangs in the\\r\\nthickest clusters. She is the largest of all; and she can never remain\\r\\nquietly on the earth, but goes up again into the black clouds. Many a\\r\\nwinter's night she flies through the streets of the town, and peeps in\\r\\nat the windows; and they then freeze in so wondrous a manner that they\\r\\nlook like flowers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have seen it,” said both the children; and so they knew that it\\r\\nwas true.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can the Snow Queen come in?” said the little girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only let her come in!” said the little boy. “Then I'd put her on the\\r\\nstove, and she'd melt.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then his grandmother patted his head and told him other stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, when little Kay was at home, and half undressed, he\\r\\nclimbed up on the chair by the window, and peeped out of the little\\r\\nhole. A few snow-flakes were falling, and one, the largest of all,\\r\\nremained lying on the edge of a flower-pot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flake of snow grew larger and larger; and at last it was like a\\r\\nyoung lady, dressed in the finest white gauze, made of a million little\\r\\nflakes like stars. She was so beautiful and delicate, but she was of\\r\\nice, of dazzling, sparkling ice; yet she lived; her eyes gazed fixedly,\\r\\nlike two stars; but there was neither quiet nor repose in them. She\\r\\nnodded towards the window, and beckoned with her hand. The little boy\\r\\nwas frightened, and jumped down from the chair; it seemed to him as if,\\r\\nat the same moment, a large bird flew past the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day it was a sharp frost--and then the spring came; the sun\\r\\nshone, the green leaves appeared, the swallows built their nests, the\\r\\nwindows were opened, and the little children again sat in their pretty\\r\\ngarden, high up on the leads at the top of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty. The little girl had\\r\\nlearned a hymn, in which there was something about roses; and then she\\r\\nthought of her own flowers; and she sang the verse to the little boy,\\r\\nwho then sang it with her:\\r\\n\\r\\n     “The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,\\r\\n     And angels descend there the children to greet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the children held each other by the hand, kissed the roses, looked\\r\\nup at the clear sunshine, and spoke as though they really saw angels\\r\\nthere. What lovely summer-days those were! How delightful to be out in\\r\\nthe air, near the fresh rose-bushes, that seem as if they would never\\r\\nfinish blossoming!\\r\\n\\r\\nKay and Gerda looked at the picture-book full of beasts and of birds;\\r\\nand it was then--the clock in the church-tower was just striking\\r\\nfive--that Kay said, “Oh! I feel such a sharp pain in my heart; and now\\r\\nsomething has got into my eye!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl put her arms around his neck. He winked his eyes; now\\r\\nthere was nothing to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it is out now,” said he; but it was not. It was just one of\\r\\nthose pieces of glass from the magic mirror that had got into his eye;\\r\\nand poor Kay had got another piece right in his heart. It will soon\\r\\nbecome like ice. It did not hurt any longer, but there it was.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you crying for?” asked he. “You look so ugly! There's nothing\\r\\nthe matter with me. Ah,” said he at once, “that rose is cankered! And\\r\\nlook, this one is quite crooked! After all, these roses are very ugly!\\r\\nThey are just like the box they are planted in!” And then he gave the\\r\\nbox a good kick with his foot, and pulled both the roses up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing?” cried the little girl; and as he perceived her\\r\\nfright, he pulled up another rose, got in at the window, and hastened\\r\\noff from dear little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards, when she brought her picture-book, he asked, “What horrid\\r\\nbeasts have you there?” And if his grandmother told them stories, he\\r\\nalways interrupted her; besides, if he could manage it, he would get\\r\\nbehind her, put on her spectacles, and imitate her way of speaking; he\\r\\ncopied all her ways, and then everybody laughed at him. He was soon able\\r\\nto imitate the gait and manner of everyone in the street. Everything\\r\\nthat was peculiar and displeasing in them--that Kay knew how to imitate:\\r\\nand at such times all the people said, “The boy is certainly very\\r\\nclever!” But it was the glass he had got in his eye; the glass that was\\r\\nsticking in his heart, which made him tease even little Gerda, whose\\r\\nwhole soul was devoted to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis games now were quite different to what they had formerly been, they\\r\\nwere so very knowing. One winter's day, when the flakes of snow were\\r\\nflying about, he spread the skirts of his blue coat, and caught the snow\\r\\nas it fell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look through this glass, Gerda,” said he. And every flake seemed\\r\\nlarger, and appeared like a magnificent flower, or beautiful star; it\\r\\nwas splendid to look at!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look, how clever!” said Kay. “That's much more interesting than real\\r\\nflowers! They are as exact as possible; there is not a fault in them, if\\r\\nthey did not melt!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long after this, that Kay came one day with large gloves on,\\r\\nand his little sledge at his back, and bawled right into Gerda's ears,\\r\\n“I have permission to go out into the square where the others are\\r\\nplaying”; and off he was in a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, in the market-place, some of the boldest of the boys used to tie\\r\\ntheir sledges to the carts as they passed by, and so they were pulled\\r\\nalong, and got a good ride. It was so capital! Just as they were in the\\r\\nvery height of their amusement, a large sledge passed by: it was painted\\r\\nquite white, and there was someone in it wrapped up in a rough white\\r\\nmantle of fur, with a rough white fur cap on his head. The sledge drove\\r\\nround the square twice, and Kay tied on his sledge as quickly as he\\r\\ncould, and off he drove with it. On they went quicker and quicker into\\r\\nthe next street; and the person who drove turned round to Kay, and\\r\\nnodded to him in a friendly manner, just as if they knew each other.\\r\\nEvery time he was going to untie his sledge, the person nodded to him,\\r\\nand then Kay sat quiet; and so on they went till they came outside\\r\\nthe gates of the town. Then the snow began to fall so thickly that the\\r\\nlittle boy could not see an arm's length before him, but still on he\\r\\nwent: when suddenly he let go the string he held in his hand in order\\r\\nto get loose from the sledge, but it was of no use; still the little\\r\\nvehicle rushed on with the quickness of the wind. He then cried as loud\\r\\nas he could, but no one heard him; the snow drifted and the sledge flew\\r\\non, and sometimes it gave a jerk as though they were driving over hedges\\r\\nand ditches. He was quite frightened, and he tried to repeat the\\r\\nLord's Prayer; but all he could do, he was only able to remember the\\r\\nmultiplication table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe snow-flakes grew larger and larger, till at last they looked just\\r\\nlike great white fowls. Suddenly they flew on one side; the large sledge\\r\\nstopped, and the person who drove rose up. It was a lady; her cloak and\\r\\ncap were of snow. She was tall and of slender figure, and of a dazzling\\r\\nwhiteness. It was the Snow Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have travelled fast,” said she; “but it is freezingly cold. Come\\r\\nunder my bearskin.” And she put him in the sledge beside her,\\r\\nwrapped the fur round him, and he felt as though he were sinking in a\\r\\nsnow-wreath.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you still cold?” asked she; and then she kissed his forehead.\\r\\nAh! it was colder than ice; it penetrated to his very heart, which was\\r\\nalready almost a frozen lump; it seemed to him as if he were about to\\r\\ndie--but a moment more and it was quite congenial to him, and he did not\\r\\nremark the cold that was around him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My sledge! Do not forget my sledge!” It was the first thing he thought\\r\\nof. It was there tied to one of the white chickens, who flew along with\\r\\nit on his back behind the large sledge. The Snow Queen kissed Kay once\\r\\nmore, and then he forgot little Gerda, grandmother, and all whom he had\\r\\nleft at his home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now you will have no more kisses,” said she, “or else I should kiss you\\r\\nto death!”\\r\\n\\r\\nKay looked at her. She was very beautiful; a more clever, or a more\\r\\nlovely countenance he could not fancy to himself; and she no longer\\r\\nappeared of ice as before, when she sat outside the window, and beckoned\\r\\nto him; in his eyes she was perfect, he did not fear her at all, and\\r\\ntold her that he could calculate in his head and with fractions, even;\\r\\nthat he knew the number of square miles there were in the different\\r\\ncountries, and how many inhabitants they contained; and she smiled while\\r\\nhe spoke. It then seemed to him as if what he knew was not enough, and\\r\\nhe looked upwards in the large huge empty space above him, and on she\\r\\nflew with him; flew high over the black clouds, while the storm moaned\\r\\nand whistled as though it were singing some old tune. On they flew\\r\\nover woods and lakes, over seas, and many lands; and beneath them the\\r\\nchilling storm rushed fast, the wolves howled, the snow crackled; above\\r\\nthem flew large screaming crows, but higher up appeared the moon, quite\\r\\nlarge and bright; and it was on it that Kay gazed during the long long\\r\\nwinter's night; while by day he slept at the feet of the Snow Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD STORY. Of the Flower-Garden At the Old Woman's Who Understood\\r\\nWitchcraft\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what became of little Gerda when Kay did not return? Where could he\\r\\nbe? Nobody knew; nobody could give any intelligence. All the boys knew\\r\\nwas, that they had seen him tie his sledge to another large and splendid\\r\\none, which drove down the street and out of the town. Nobody knew\\r\\nwhere he was; many sad tears were shed, and little Gerda wept long and\\r\\nbitterly; at last she said he must be dead; that he had been drowned in\\r\\nthe river which flowed close to the town. Oh! those were very long and\\r\\ndismal winter evenings!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last spring came, with its warm sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kay is dead and gone!” said little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I don't believe,” said the Sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kay is dead and gone!” said she to the Swallows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I don't believe,” said they: and at last little Gerda did not\\r\\nthink so any longer either.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I'll put on my red shoes,” said she, one morning; “Kay has never seen\\r\\nthem, and then I'll go down to the river and ask there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite early; she kissed her old grandmother, who was still\\r\\nasleep, put on her red shoes, and went alone to the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will make you a\\r\\npresent of my red shoes, if you will give him back to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as it seemed to her, the blue waves nodded in a strange manner;\\r\\nthen she took off her red shoes, the most precious things she possessed,\\r\\nand threw them both into the river. But they fell close to the bank, and\\r\\nthe little waves bore them immediately to land; it was as if the stream\\r\\nwould not take what was dearest to her; for in reality it had not got\\r\\nlittle Kay; but Gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far\\r\\nenough, so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes, went\\r\\nto the farthest end, and threw out the shoes. But the boat was not\\r\\nfastened, and the motion which she occasioned, made it drift from the\\r\\nshore. She observed this, and hastened to get back; but before she could\\r\\ndo so, the boat was more than a yard from the land, and was gliding\\r\\nquickly onward.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Gerda was very frightened, and began to cry; but no one heard her\\r\\nexcept the sparrows, and they could not carry her to land; but they flew\\r\\nalong the bank, and sang as if to comfort her, “Here we are! Here we\\r\\nare!” The boat drifted with the stream, little Gerda sat quite still\\r\\nwithout shoes, for they were swimming behind the boat, but she could not\\r\\nreach them, because the boat went much faster than they did.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banks on both sides were beautiful; lovely flowers, venerable trees,\\r\\nand slopes with sheep and cows, but not a human being was to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay,” said she; and then\\r\\nshe grew less sad. She rose, and looked for many hours at the beautiful\\r\\ngreen banks. Presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard, where was\\r\\na little cottage with curious red and blue windows; it was thatched,\\r\\nand before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry, and presented arms when\\r\\nanyone went past.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerda called to them, for she thought they were alive; but they, of\\r\\ncourse, did not answer. She came close to them, for the stream drifted\\r\\nthe boat quite near the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerda called still louder, and an old woman then came out of the\\r\\ncottage, leaning upon a crooked stick. She had a large broad-brimmed hat\\r\\non, painted with the most splendid flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor little child!” said the old woman. “How did you get upon the large\\r\\nrapid river, to be driven about so in the wide world!” And then the\\r\\nold woman went into the water, caught hold of the boat with her crooked\\r\\nstick, drew it to the bank, and lifted little Gerda out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda was so glad to be on dry land again; but she was rather afraid\\r\\nof the strange old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But come and tell me who you are, and how you came here,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda told her all; and the old woman shook her head and said,\\r\\n“A-hem! a-hem!” and when Gerda had told her everything, and asked her if\\r\\nshe had not seen little Kay, the woman answered that he had not passed\\r\\nthere, but he no doubt would come; and she told her not to be cast down,\\r\\nbut taste her cherries, and look at her flowers, which were finer than\\r\\nany in a picture-book, each of which could tell a whole story. She then\\r\\ntook Gerda by the hand, led her into the little cottage, and locked the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe windows were very high up; the glass was red, blue, and green, and\\r\\nthe sunlight shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of colors. On\\r\\nthe table stood the most exquisite cherries, and Gerda ate as many as\\r\\nshe chose, for she had permission to do so. While she was eating, the\\r\\nold woman combed her hair with a golden comb, and her hair curled and\\r\\nshone with a lovely golden color around that sweet little face, which\\r\\nwas so round and so like a rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have often longed for such a dear little girl,” said the old woman.\\r\\n“Now you shall see how well we agree together”; and while she combed\\r\\nlittle Gerda's hair, the child forgot her foster-brother Kay more and\\r\\nmore, for the old woman understood magic; but she was no evil being, she\\r\\nonly practised witchcraft a little for her own private amusement, and\\r\\nnow she wanted very much to keep little Gerda. She therefore went out\\r\\nin the garden, stretched out her crooked stick towards the rose-bushes,\\r\\nwhich, beautifully as they were blowing, all sank into the earth and no\\r\\none could tell where they had stood. The old woman feared that if Gerda\\r\\nshould see the roses, she would then think of her own, would remember\\r\\nlittle Kay, and run away from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe now led Gerda into the flower-garden. Oh, what odour and what\\r\\nloveliness was there! Every flower that one could think of, and of every\\r\\nseason, stood there in fullest bloom; no picture-book could be gayer or\\r\\nmore beautiful. Gerda jumped for joy, and played till the sun set behind\\r\\nthe tall cherry-tree; she then had a pretty bed, with a red silken\\r\\ncoverlet filled with blue violets. She fell asleep, and had as pleasant\\r\\ndreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine,\\r\\nand thus passed away a day. Gerda knew every flower; and, numerous as\\r\\nthey were, it still seemed to Gerda that one was wanting, though she\\r\\ndid not know which. One day while she was looking at the hat of the old\\r\\nwoman painted with flowers, the most beautiful of them all seemed to her\\r\\nto be a rose. The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat\\r\\nwhen she made the others vanish in the earth. But so it is when one's\\r\\nthoughts are not collected. “What!” said Gerda. “Are there no roses\\r\\nhere?” and she ran about amongst the flowerbeds, and looked, and looked,\\r\\nbut there was not one to be found. She then sat down and wept; but her\\r\\nhot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk; and when her warm tears\\r\\nwatered the ground, the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as\\r\\nwhen it had been swallowed up. Gerda kissed the roses, thought of her\\r\\nown dear roses at home, and with them of little Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, how long I have stayed!” said the little girl. “I intended to look\\r\\nfor Kay! Don't you know where he is?” she asked of the roses. “Do you\\r\\nthink he is dead and gone?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dead he certainly is not,” said the Roses. “We have been in the earth\\r\\nwhere all the dead are, but Kay was not there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Many thanks!” said little Gerda; and she went to the other flowers,\\r\\nlooked into their cups, and asked, “Don't you know where little Kay is?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut every flower stood in the sunshine, and dreamed its own fairy tale\\r\\nor its own story: and they all told her very many things, but not one\\r\\nknew anything of Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, what did the Tiger-Lily say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hearest thou not the drum? Bum! Bum! Those are the only two tones.\\r\\nAlways bum! Bum! Hark to the plaintive song of the old woman, to the\\r\\ncall of the priests! The Hindoo woman in her long robe stands upon the\\r\\nfuneral pile; the flames rise around her and her dead husband, but the\\r\\nHindoo woman thinks on the living one in the surrounding circle; on him\\r\\nwhose eyes burn hotter than the flames--on him, the fire of whose eyes\\r\\npierces her heart more than the flames which soon will burn her body to\\r\\nashes. Can the heart's flame die in the flame of the funeral pile?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don't understand that at all,” said little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is my story,” said the Lily.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did the Convolvulus say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Projecting over a narrow mountain-path there hangs an old feudal\\r\\ncastle. Thick evergreens grow on the dilapidated walls, and around the\\r\\naltar, where a lovely maiden is standing: she bends over the railing and\\r\\nlooks out upon the rose. No fresher rose hangs on the branches than she;\\r\\nno appleblossom carried away by the wind is more buoyant! How her silken\\r\\nrobe is rustling!\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Is he not yet come?'”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it Kay that you mean?” asked little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am speaking about my story--about my dream,” answered the\\r\\nConvolvulus.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did the Snowdrops say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Between the trees a long board is hanging--it is a swing. Two little\\r\\ngirls are sitting in it, and swing themselves backwards and forwards;\\r\\ntheir frocks are as white as snow, and long green silk ribands flutter\\r\\nfrom their bonnets. Their brother, who is older than they are, stands up\\r\\nin the swing; he twines his arms round the cords to hold himself fast,\\r\\nfor in one hand he has a little cup, and in the other a clay-pipe. He is\\r\\nblowing soap-bubbles. The swing moves, and the bubbles float in charming\\r\\nchanging colors: the last is still hanging to the end of the pipe, and\\r\\nrocks in the breeze. The swing moves. The little black dog, as light as\\r\\na soap-bubble, jumps up on his hind legs to try to get into the swing.\\r\\nIt moves, the dog falls down, barks, and is angry. They tease him; the\\r\\nbubble bursts! A swing, a bursting bubble--such is my song!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What you relate may be very pretty, but you tell it in so melancholy a\\r\\nmanner, and do not mention Kay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do the Hyacinths say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“There were once upon a time three sisters, quite transparent, and very\\r\\nbeautiful. The robe of the one was red, that of the second blue, and\\r\\nthat of the third white. They danced hand in hand beside the calm\\r\\nlake in the clear moonshine. They were not elfin maidens, but mortal\\r\\nchildren. A sweet fragrance was smelt, and the maidens vanished in the\\r\\nwood; the fragrance grew stronger--three coffins, and in them three\\r\\nlovely maidens, glided out of the forest and across the lake: the\\r\\nshining glow-worms flew around like little floating lights. Do the\\r\\ndancing maidens sleep, or are they dead? The odour of the flowers says\\r\\nthey are corpses; the evening bell tolls for the dead!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You make me quite sad,” said little Gerda. “I cannot help thinking of\\r\\nthe dead maidens. Oh! is little Kay really dead? The Roses have been in\\r\\nthe earth, and they say no.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ding, dong!” sounded the Hyacinth bells. “We do not toll for little\\r\\nKay; we do not know him. That is our way of singing, the only one we\\r\\nhave.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda went to the Ranunculuses, that looked forth from among the\\r\\nshining green leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a little bright sun!” said Gerda. “Tell me if you know where I\\r\\ncan find my playfellow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Ranunculus shone brightly, and looked again at Gerda. What\\r\\nsong could the Ranunculus sing? It was one that said nothing about Kay\\r\\neither.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In a small court the bright sun was shining in the first days of\\r\\nspring. The beams glided down the white walls of a neighbor's house, and\\r\\nclose by the fresh yellow flowers were growing, shining like gold in\\r\\nthe warm sun-rays. An old grandmother was sitting in the air; her\\r\\ngrand-daughter, the poor and lovely servant just come for a short visit.\\r\\nShe knows her grandmother. There was gold, pure virgin gold in that\\r\\nblessed kiss. There, that is my little story,” said the Ranunculus.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My poor old grandmother!” sighed Gerda. “Yes, she is longing for me,\\r\\nno doubt: she is sorrowing for me, as she did for little Kay. But I\\r\\nwill soon come home, and then I will bring Kay with me. It is of no use\\r\\nasking the flowers; they only know their own old rhymes, and can tell me\\r\\nnothing.” And she tucked up her frock, to enable her to run quicker; but\\r\\nthe Narcissus gave her a knock on the leg, just as she was going to\\r\\njump over it. So she stood still, looked at the long yellow flower, and\\r\\nasked, “You perhaps know something?” and she bent down to the Narcissus.\\r\\nAnd what did it say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can see myself--I can see myself! Oh, how odorous I am! Up in the\\r\\nlittle garret there stands, half-dressed, a little Dancer. She stands\\r\\nnow on one leg, now on both; she despises the whole world; yet she lives\\r\\nonly in imagination. She pours water out of the teapot over a piece of\\r\\nstuff which she holds in her hand; it is the bodice; cleanliness is a\\r\\nfine thing. The white dress is hanging on the hook; it was washed in the\\r\\nteapot, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, ties a saffron-colored\\r\\nkerchief round her neck, and then the gown looks whiter. I can see\\r\\nmyself--I can see myself!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That's nothing to me,” said little Gerda. “That does not concern me.”\\r\\n And then off she ran to the further end of the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gate was locked, but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened,\\r\\nand the gate opened; and little Gerda ran off barefooted into the wide\\r\\nworld. She looked round her thrice, but no one followed her. At last she\\r\\ncould run no longer; she sat down on a large stone, and when she looked\\r\\nabout her, she saw that the summer had passed; it was late in the\\r\\nautumn, but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden, where\\r\\nthere was always sunshine, and where there were flowers the whole year\\r\\nround.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me, how long I have staid!” said Gerda. “Autumn is come. I must\\r\\nnot rest any longer.” And she got up to go further.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, how tender and wearied her little feet were! All around it looked\\r\\nso cold and raw: the long willow-leaves were quite yellow, and the fog\\r\\ndripped from them like water; one leaf fell after the other: the sloes\\r\\nonly stood full of fruit, which set one's teeth on edge. Oh, how dark\\r\\nand comfortless it was in the dreary world!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOURTH STORY. The Prince and Princess\\r\\n\\r\\nGerda was obliged to rest herself again, when, exactly opposite to her,\\r\\na large Raven came hopping over the white snow. He had long been looking\\r\\nat Gerda and shaking his head; and now he said, “Caw! Caw!” Good day!\\r\\nGood day! He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the\\r\\nlittle girl, and asked her where she was going all alone. The word\\r\\n“alone” Gerda understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed\\r\\nby it; so she told the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not\\r\\nseen Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Raven nodded very gravely, and said, “It may be--it may be!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, do you really think so?” cried the little girl; and she nearly\\r\\nsqueezed the Raven to death, so much did she kiss him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gently, gently,” said the Raven. “I think I know; I think that it may\\r\\nbe little Kay. But now he has forgotten you for the Princess.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does he live with a Princess?” asked Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes--listen,” said the Raven; “but it will be difficult for me to\\r\\nspeak your language. If you understand the Raven language I can tell you\\r\\nbetter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I have not learnt it,” said Gerda; “but my grandmother understands\\r\\nit, and she can speak gibberish too. I wish I had learnt it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No matter,” said the Raven; “I will tell you as well as I can; however,\\r\\nit will be bad enough.” And then he told all he knew.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the kingdom where we now are there lives a Princess, who is\\r\\nextraordinarily clever; for she has read all the newspapers in the whole\\r\\nworld, and has forgotten them again--so clever is she. She was lately,\\r\\nit is said, sitting on her throne--which is not very amusing after\\r\\nall--when she began humming an old tune, and it was just, 'Oh, why\\r\\nshould I not be married?' 'That song is not without its meaning,' said\\r\\nshe, and so then she was determined to marry; but she would have a\\r\\nhusband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to--not\\r\\none who looked only as if he were a great personage, for that is so\\r\\ntiresome. She then had all the ladies of the court drummed together; and\\r\\nwhen they heard her intention, all were very pleased, and said, 'We are\\r\\nvery glad to hear it; it is the very thing we were thinking of.' You may\\r\\nbelieve every word I say,” said the Raven; “for I have a tame sweetheart\\r\\nthat hops about in the palace quite free, and it was she who told me all\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The newspapers appeared forthwith with a border of hearts and the\\r\\ninitials of the Princess; and therein you might read that every\\r\\ngood-looking young man was at liberty to come to the palace and speak to\\r\\nthe Princess; and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt himself at\\r\\nhome there, that one the Princess would choose for her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Yes,” said the Raven, “you may believe it; it is as true as I am\\r\\nsitting here. People came in crowds; there was a crush and a hurry, but\\r\\nno one was successful either on the first or second day. They could all\\r\\ntalk well enough when they were out in the street; but as soon as\\r\\nthey came inside the palace gates, and saw the guard richly dressed\\r\\nin silver, and the lackeys in gold on the staircase, and the large\\r\\nilluminated saloons, then they were abashed; and when they stood before\\r\\nthe throne on which the Princess was sitting, all they could do was\\r\\nto repeat the last word they had uttered, and to hear it again did not\\r\\ninterest her very much. It was just as if the people within were under\\r\\na charm, and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the\\r\\nstreet; for then--oh, then--they could chatter enough. There was a whole\\r\\nrow of them standing from the town-gates to the palace. I was there\\r\\nmyself to look,” said the Raven. “They grew hungry and thirsty; but from\\r\\nthe palace they got nothing whatever, not even a glass of water. Some\\r\\nof the cleverest, it is true, had taken bread and butter with them:\\r\\nbut none shared it with his neighbor, for each thought, 'Let him look\\r\\nhungry, and then the Princess won't have him.'”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But Kay--little Kay,” said Gerda, “when did he come? Was he among the\\r\\nnumber?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Patience, patience; we are just come to him. It was on the third day\\r\\nwhen a little personage without horse or equipage, came marching right\\r\\nboldly up to the palace; his eyes shone like yours, he had beautiful\\r\\nlong hair, but his clothes were very shabby.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was Kay,” cried Gerda, with a voice of delight. “Oh, now I've\\r\\nfound him!” and she clapped her hands for joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He had a little knapsack at his back,” said the Raven.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, that was certainly his sledge,” said Gerda; “for when he went away\\r\\nhe took his sledge with him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That may be,” said the Raven; “I did not examine him so minutely; but\\r\\nI know from my tame sweetheart, that when he came into the court-yard\\r\\nof the palace, and saw the body-guard in silver, the lackeys on the\\r\\nstaircase, he was not the least abashed; he nodded, and said to them,\\r\\n'It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs; for my part, I shall\\r\\ngo in.' The saloons were gleaming with lustres--privy councillors and\\r\\nexcellencies were walking about barefooted, and wore gold keys; it was\\r\\nenough to make any one feel uncomfortable. His boots creaked, too, so\\r\\nloudly, but still he was not at all afraid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That's Kay for certain,” said Gerda. “I know he had on new boots; I\\r\\nhave heard them creaking in grandmama's room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they creaked,” said the Raven. “And on he went boldly up to the\\r\\nPrincess, who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel.\\r\\nAll the ladies of the court, with their attendants and attendants'\\r\\nattendants, and all the cavaliers, with their gentlemen and gentlemen's\\r\\ngentlemen, stood round; and the nearer they stood to the door, the\\r\\nprouder they looked. It was hardly possible to look at the gentleman's\\r\\ngentleman, so very haughtily did he stand in the doorway.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must have been terrible,” said little Gerda. “And did Kay get the\\r\\nPrincess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Were I not a Raven, I should have taken the Princess myself, although\\r\\nI am promised. It is said he spoke as well as I speak when I talk Raven\\r\\nlanguage; this I learned from my tame sweetheart. He was bold and nicely\\r\\nbehaved; he had not come to woo the Princess, but only to hear her\\r\\nwisdom. She pleased him, and he pleased her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes; for certain that was Kay,” said Gerda. “He was so clever;\\r\\nhe could reckon fractions in his head. Oh, won't you take me to the\\r\\npalace?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is very easily said,” answered the Raven. “But how are we to\\r\\nmanage it? I'll speak to my tame sweetheart about it: she must advise\\r\\nus; for so much I must tell you, such a little girl as you are will\\r\\nnever get permission to enter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes I shall,” said Gerda; “when Kay hears that I am here, he will\\r\\ncome out directly to fetch me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait for me here on these steps,” said the Raven. He moved his head\\r\\nbackwards and forwards and flew away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening was closing in when the Raven returned. “Caw--caw!” said he.\\r\\n“She sends you her compliments; and here is a roll for you. She took\\r\\nit out of the kitchen, where there is bread enough. You are hungry,\\r\\nno doubt. It is not possible for you to enter the palace, for you are\\r\\nbarefooted: the guards in silver, and the lackeys in gold, would not\\r\\nallow it; but do not cry, you shall come in still. My sweetheart knows a\\r\\nlittle back stair that leads to the bedchamber, and she knows where she\\r\\ncan get the key of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they went into the garden in the large avenue, where one leaf was\\r\\nfalling after the other; and when the lights in the palace had all\\r\\ngradually disappeared, the Raven led little Gerda to the back door,\\r\\nwhich stood half open.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, how Gerda's heart beat with anxiety and longing! It was just as if\\r\\nshe had been about to do something wrong; and yet she only wanted to\\r\\nknow if little Kay was there. Yes, he must be there. She called to mind\\r\\nhis intelligent eyes, and his long hair, so vividly, she could quite see\\r\\nhim as he used to laugh when they were sitting under the roses at home.\\r\\n“He will, no doubt, be glad to see you--to hear what a long way you have\\r\\ncome for his sake; to know how unhappy all at home were when he did not\\r\\ncome back.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, what a fright and a joy it was!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now on the stairs. A single lamp was burning there; and on the\\r\\nfloor stood the tame Raven, turning her head on every side and looking\\r\\nat Gerda, who bowed as her grandmother had taught her to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My intended has told me so much good of you, my dear young lady,” said\\r\\nthe tame Raven. “Your tale is very affecting. If you will take the lamp,\\r\\nI will go before. We will go straight on, for we shall meet no one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think there is somebody just behind us,” said Gerda; and something\\r\\nrushed past: it was like shadowy figures on the wall; horses with\\r\\nflowing manes and thin legs, huntsmen, ladies and gentlemen on\\r\\nhorseback.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are only dreams,” said the Raven. “They come to fetch the thoughts\\r\\nof the high personages to the chase; 'tis well, for now you can observe\\r\\nthem in bed all the better. But let me find, when you enjoy honor and\\r\\ndistinction, that you possess a grateful heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tut! That's not worth talking about,” said the Raven of the woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now entered the first saloon, which was of rose-colored satin, with\\r\\nartificial flowers on the wall. Here the dreams were rushing past,\\r\\nbut they hastened by so quickly that Gerda could not see the high\\r\\npersonages. One hall was more magnificent than the other; one might\\r\\nindeed well be abashed; and at last they came into the bedchamber. The\\r\\nceiling of the room resembled a large palm-tree with leaves of glass,\\r\\nof costly glass; and in the middle, from a thick golden stem, hung two\\r\\nbeds, each of which resembled a lily. One was white, and in this lay the\\r\\nPrincess; the other was red, and it was here that Gerda was to look for\\r\\nlittle Kay. She bent back one of the red leaves, and saw a brown neck.\\r\\nOh! that was Kay! She called him quite loud by name, held the lamp\\r\\ntowards him--the dreams rushed back again into the chamber--he awoke,\\r\\nturned his head, and--it was not little Kay!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prince was only like him about the neck; but he was young and\\r\\nhandsome. And out of the white lily leaves the Princess peeped, too,\\r\\nand asked what was the matter. Then little Gerda cried, and told her her\\r\\nwhole history, and all that the Ravens had done for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor little thing!” said the Prince and the Princess. They praised the\\r\\nRavens very much, and told them they were not at all angry with them,\\r\\nbut they were not to do so again. However, they should have a reward.\\r\\n“Will you fly about here at liberty,” asked the Princess; “or would you\\r\\nlike to have a fixed appointment as court ravens, with all the broken\\r\\nbits from the kitchen?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd both the Ravens nodded, and begged for a fixed appointment; for\\r\\nthey thought of their old age, and said, “It is a good thing to have a\\r\\nprovision for our old days.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Prince got up and let Gerda sleep in his bed, and more than this\\r\\nhe could not do. She folded her little hands and thought, “How good men\\r\\nand animals are!” and she then fell asleep and slept soundly. All the\\r\\ndreams flew in again, and they now looked like the angels; they drew\\r\\na little sledge, in which little Kay sat and nodded his head; but the\\r\\nwhole was only a dream, and therefore it all vanished as soon as she\\r\\nawoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and velvet. They\\r\\noffered to let her stay at the palace, and lead a happy life; but she\\r\\nbegged to have a little carriage with a horse in front, and for a small\\r\\npair of shoes; then, she said, she would again go forth in the wide\\r\\nworld and look for Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\nShoes and a muff were given her; she was, too, dressed very nicely; and\\r\\nwhen she was about to set off, a new carriage stopped before the door.\\r\\nIt was of pure gold, and the arms of the Prince and Princess shone\\r\\nlike a star upon it; the coachman, the footmen, and the outriders, for\\r\\noutriders were there, too, all wore golden crowns. The Prince and the\\r\\nPrincess assisted her into the carriage themselves, and wished her all\\r\\nsuccess. The Raven of the woods, who was now married, accompanied her\\r\\nfor the first three miles. He sat beside Gerda, for he could not bear\\r\\nriding backwards; the other Raven stood in the doorway, and flapped her\\r\\nwings; she could not accompany Gerda, because she suffered from headache\\r\\nsince she had had a fixed appointment and ate so much. The carriage\\r\\nwas lined inside with sugar-plums, and in the seats were fruits and\\r\\ngingerbread.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Farewell! Farewell!” cried Prince and Princess; and Gerda wept, and\\r\\nthe Raven wept. Thus passed the first miles; and then the Raven bade her\\r\\nfarewell, and this was the most painful separation of all. He flew into\\r\\na tree, and beat his black wings as long as he could see the carriage,\\r\\nthat shone from afar like a sunbeam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFTH STORY. The Little Robber Maiden\\r\\n\\r\\nThey drove through the dark wood; but the carriage shone like a torch,\\r\\nand it dazzled the eyes of the robbers, so that they could not bear to\\r\\nlook at it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis gold! 'Tis gold!” they cried; and they rushed forward, seized\\r\\nthe horses, knocked down the little postilion, the coachman, and the\\r\\nservants, and pulled little Gerda out of the carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How plump, how beautiful she is! She must have been fed on\\r\\nnut-kernels,” said the old female robber, who had a long, scrubby beard,\\r\\nand bushy eyebrows that hung down over her eyes. “She is as good as a\\r\\nfatted lamb! How nice she will be!” And then she drew out a knife, the\\r\\nblade of which shone so that it was quite dreadful to behold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” cried the woman at the same moment. She had been bitten in the ear\\r\\nby her own little daughter, who hung at her back; and who was so wild\\r\\nand unmanageable, that it was quite amusing to see her. “You naughty\\r\\nchild!” said the mother: and now she had not time to kill Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She shall play with me,” said the little robber child. “She shall give\\r\\nme her muff, and her pretty frock; she shall sleep in my bed!” And then\\r\\nshe gave her mother another bite, so that she jumped, and ran round with\\r\\nthe pain; and the Robbers laughed, and said, “Look, how she is dancing\\r\\nwith the little one!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will go into the carriage,” said the little robber maiden; and she\\r\\nwould have her will, for she was very spoiled and very headstrong. She\\r\\nand Gerda got in; and then away they drove over the stumps of felled\\r\\ntrees, deeper and deeper into the woods. The little robber maiden was as\\r\\ntall as Gerda, but stronger, broader-shouldered, and of dark complexion;\\r\\nher eyes were quite black; they looked almost melancholy. She embraced\\r\\nlittle Gerda, and said, “They shall not kill you as long as I am not\\r\\ndispleased with you. You are, doubtless, a Princess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said little Gerda; who then related all that had happened to her,\\r\\nand how much she cared about little Kay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little robber maiden looked at her with a serious air, nodded her\\r\\nhead slightly, and said, “They shall not kill you, even if I am angry\\r\\nwith you: then I will do it myself”; and she dried Gerda's eyes, and put\\r\\nboth her hands in the handsome muff, which was so soft and warm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the carriage stopped. They were in the midst of the court-yard\\r\\nof a robber's castle. It was full of cracks from top to bottom; and out\\r\\nof the openings magpies and rooks were flying; and the great bull-dogs,\\r\\neach of which looked as if he could swallow a man, jumped up, but they\\r\\ndid not bark, for that was forbidden.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of the large, old, smoking hall burnt a great fire on the\\r\\nstone floor. The smoke disappeared under the stones, and had to seek\\r\\nits own egress. In an immense caldron soup was boiling; and rabbits and\\r\\nhares were being roasted on a spit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shall sleep with me to-night, with all my animals,” said the little\\r\\nrobber maiden. They had something to eat and drink; and then went into\\r\\na corner, where straw and carpets were lying. Beside them, on laths and\\r\\nperches, sat nearly a hundred pigeons, all asleep, seemingly; but yet\\r\\nthey moved a little when the robber maiden came. “They are all mine,”\\r\\n said she, at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs\\r\\nand shaking it so that its wings fluttered. “Kiss it,” cried the little\\r\\ngirl, and flung the pigeon in Gerda's face. “Up there is the rabble of\\r\\nthe wood,” continued she, pointing to several laths which were fastened\\r\\nbefore a hole high up in the wall; “that's the rabble; they would all\\r\\nfly away immediately, if they were not well fastened in. And here is my\\r\\ndear old Bac”; and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer, that had a\\r\\nbright copper ring round its neck, and was tethered to the spot. “We are\\r\\nobliged to lock this fellow in too, or he would make his escape. Every\\r\\nevening I tickle his neck with my sharp knife; he is so frightened at\\r\\nit!” and the little girl drew forth a long knife, from a crack in the\\r\\nwall, and let it glide over the Reindeer's neck. The poor animal kicked;\\r\\nthe girl laughed, and pulled Gerda into bed with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you intend to keep your knife while you sleep?” asked Gerda; looking\\r\\nat it rather fearfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I always sleep with the knife,” said the little robber maiden. “There\\r\\nis no knowing what may happen. But tell me now, once more, all about\\r\\nlittle Kay; and why you have started off in the wide world alone.” And\\r\\nGerda related all, from the very beginning: the Wood-pigeons cooed above\\r\\nin their cage, and the others slept. The little robber maiden wound her\\r\\narm round Gerda's neck, held the knife in the other hand, and snored so\\r\\nloud that everybody could hear her; but Gerda could not close her eyes,\\r\\nfor she did not know whether she was to live or die. The robbers sat\\r\\nround the fire, sang and drank; and the old female robber jumped about\\r\\nso, that it was quite dreadful for Gerda to see her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Wood-pigeons said, “Coo! Coo! We have seen little Kay! A white\\r\\nhen carries his sledge; he himself sat in the carriage of the Snow\\r\\nQueen, who passed here, down just over the wood, as we lay in our nest.\\r\\nShe blew upon us young ones; and all died except we two. Coo! Coo!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is that you say up there?” cried little Gerda. “Where did the Snow\\r\\nQueen go to? Do you know anything about it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is no doubt gone to Lapland; for there is always snow and ice\\r\\nthere. Only ask the Reindeer, who is tethered there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ice and snow is there! There it is, glorious and beautiful!” said the\\r\\nReindeer. “One can spring about in the large shining valleys! The Snow\\r\\nQueen has her summer-tent there; but her fixed abode is high up towards\\r\\nthe North Pole, on the Island called Spitzbergen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Kay! Poor little Kay!” sighed Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you choose to be quiet?” said the robber maiden. “If you don't, I\\r\\nshall make you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Gerda told her all that the Wood-pigeons had said; and\\r\\nthe little maiden looked very serious, but she nodded her head, and\\r\\nsaid, “That's no matter--that's no matter. Do you know where Lapland\\r\\nlies!” she asked of the Reindeer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who should know better than I?” said the animal; and his eyes rolled in\\r\\nhis head. “I was born and bred there--there I leapt about on the fields\\r\\nof snow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen,” said the robber maiden to Gerda. “You see that the men are\\r\\ngone; but my mother is still here, and will remain. However, towards\\r\\nmorning she takes a draught out of the large flask, and then she sleeps\\r\\na little: then I will do something for you.” She now jumped out of bed,\\r\\nflew to her mother; with her arms round her neck, and pulling her by the\\r\\nbeard, said, “Good morrow, my own sweet nanny-goat of a mother.” And her\\r\\nmother took hold of her nose, and pinched it till it was red and blue;\\r\\nbut this was all done out of pure love.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the mother had taken a sup at her flask, and was having a nap, the\\r\\nlittle robber maiden went to the Reindeer, and said, “I should very much\\r\\nlike to give you still many a tickling with the sharp knife, for then\\r\\nyou are so amusing; however, I will untether you, and help you out,\\r\\nso that you may go back to Lapland. But you must make good use of your\\r\\nlegs; and take this little girl for me to the palace of the Snow Queen,\\r\\nwhere her playfellow is. You have heard, I suppose, all she said; for\\r\\nshe spoke loud enough, and you were listening.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reindeer gave a bound for joy. The robber maiden lifted up little\\r\\nGerda, and took the precaution to bind her fast on the Reindeer's back;\\r\\nshe even gave her a small cushion to sit on. “Here are your worsted\\r\\nleggins, for it will be cold; but the muff I shall keep for myself, for\\r\\nit is so very pretty. But I do not wish you to be cold. Here is a pair\\r\\nof lined gloves of my mother's; they just reach up to your elbow. On\\r\\nwith them! Now you look about the hands just like my ugly old mother!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda wept for joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can't bear to see you fretting,” said the little robber maiden. “This\\r\\nis just the time when you ought to look pleased. Here are two loaves and\\r\\na ham for you, so that you won't starve.” The bread and the meat were\\r\\nfastened to the Reindeer's back; the little maiden opened the door,\\r\\ncalled in all the dogs, and then with her knife cut the rope that\\r\\nfastened the animal, and said to him, “Now, off with you; but take good\\r\\ncare of the little girl!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda stretched out her hands with the large wadded gloves towards\\r\\nthe robber maiden, and said, “Farewell!” and the Reindeer flew on over\\r\\nbush and bramble through the great wood, over moor and heath, as fast as\\r\\nhe could go.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ddsa! Ddsa!” was heard in the sky. It was just as if somebody was\\r\\nsneezing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These are my old northern-lights,” said the Reindeer, “look how they\\r\\ngleam!” And on he now sped still quicker--day and night on he went: the\\r\\nloaves were consumed, and the ham too; and now they were in Lapland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIXTH STORY. The Lapland Woman and the Finland Woman\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly they stopped before a little house, which looked very\\r\\nmiserable. The roof reached to the ground; and the door was so low, that\\r\\nthe family were obliged to creep upon their stomachs when they went in\\r\\nor out. Nobody was at home except an old Lapland woman, who was dressing\\r\\nfish by the light of an oil lamp. And the Reindeer told her the whole\\r\\nof Gerda's history, but first of all his own; for that seemed to him of\\r\\nmuch greater importance. Gerda was so chilled that she could not speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor thing,” said the Lapland woman, “you have far to run still. You\\r\\nhave more than a hundred miles to go before you get to Finland; there\\r\\nthe Snow Queen has her country-house, and burns blue lights every\\r\\nevening. I will give you a few words from me, which I will write on a\\r\\ndried haberdine, for paper I have none; this you can take with you to\\r\\nthe Finland woman, and she will be able to give you more information\\r\\nthan I can.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Gerda had warmed herself, and had eaten and drunk, the Lapland\\r\\nwoman wrote a few words on a dried haberdine, begged Gerda to take care\\r\\nof them, put her on the Reindeer, bound her fast, and away sprang the\\r\\nanimal. “Ddsa! Ddsa!” was again heard in the air; the most charming\\r\\nblue lights burned the whole night in the sky, and at last they came to\\r\\nFinland. They knocked at the chimney of the Finland woman; for as to a\\r\\ndoor, she had none.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was such a heat inside that the Finland woman herself went about\\r\\nalmost naked. She was diminutive and dirty. She immediately loosened\\r\\nlittle Gerda's clothes, pulled off her thick gloves and boots; for\\r\\notherwise the heat would have been too great--and after laying a piece\\r\\nof ice on the Reindeer's head, read what was written on the fish-skin.\\r\\nShe read it three times: she then knew it by heart; so she put the fish\\r\\ninto the cupboard--for it might very well be eaten, and she never threw\\r\\nanything away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Reindeer related his own story first, and afterwards that of\\r\\nlittle Gerda; and the Finland woman winked her eyes, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are so clever,” said the Reindeer; “you can, I know, twist all the\\r\\nwinds of the world together in a knot. If the seaman loosens one knot,\\r\\nthen he has a good wind; if a second, then it blows pretty stiffly; if\\r\\nhe undoes the third and fourth, then it rages so that the forests are\\r\\nupturned. Will you give the little maiden a potion, that she may possess\\r\\nthe strength of twelve men, and vanquish the Snow Queen?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The strength of twelve men!” said the Finland woman. “Much good that\\r\\nwould be!” Then she went to a cupboard, and drew out a large skin rolled\\r\\nup. When she had unrolled it, strange characters were to be seen written\\r\\nthereon; and the Finland woman read at such a rate that the perspiration\\r\\ntrickled down her forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda, and Gerda looked so\\r\\nimploringly with tearful eyes at the Finland woman, that she winked, and\\r\\ndrew the Reindeer aside into a corner, where they whispered together,\\r\\nwhile the animal got some fresh ice put on his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Tis true little Kay is at the Snow Queen's, and finds everything there\\r\\nquite to his taste; and he thinks it the very best place in the world;\\r\\nbut the reason of that is, he has a splinter of glass in his eye, and in\\r\\nhis heart. These must be got out first; otherwise he will never go back\\r\\nto mankind, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But can you give little Gerda nothing to take which will endue her with\\r\\npower over the whole?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can give her no more power than what she has already. Don't you see\\r\\nhow great it is? Don't you see how men and animals are forced to serve\\r\\nher; how well she gets through the world barefooted? She must not hear\\r\\nof her power from us; that power lies in her heart, because she is\\r\\na sweet and innocent child! If she cannot get to the Snow Queen by\\r\\nherself, and rid little Kay of the glass, we cannot help her. Two miles\\r\\nhence the garden of the Snow Queen begins; thither you may carry the\\r\\nlittle girl. Set her down by the large bush with red berries, standing\\r\\nin the snow; don't stay talking, but hasten back as fast as possible.”\\r\\n And now the Finland woman placed little Gerda on the Reindeer's back,\\r\\nand off he ran with all imaginable speed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! I have not got my boots! I have not brought my gloves!” cried\\r\\nlittle Gerda. She remarked she was without them from the cutting frost;\\r\\nbut the Reindeer dared not stand still; on he ran till he came to the\\r\\ngreat bush with the red berries, and there he set Gerda down, kissed her\\r\\nmouth, while large bright tears flowed from the animal's eyes, and then\\r\\nback he went as fast as possible. There stood poor Gerda now, without\\r\\nshoes or gloves, in the very middle of dreadful icy Finland.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ran on as fast as she could. There then came a whole regiment of\\r\\nsnow-flakes, but they did not fall from above, and they were quite\\r\\nbright and shining from the Aurora Borealis. The flakes ran along\\r\\nthe ground, and the nearer they came the larger they grew. Gerda well\\r\\nremembered how large and strange the snow-flakes appeared when she\\r\\nonce saw them through a magnifying-glass; but now they were large and\\r\\nterrific in another manner--they were all alive. They were the outposts\\r\\nof the Snow Queen. They had the most wondrous shapes; some looked like\\r\\nlarge ugly porcupines; others like snakes knotted together, with their\\r\\nheads sticking out; and others, again, like small fat bears, with the\\r\\nhair standing on end: all were of dazzling whiteness--all were living\\r\\nsnow-flakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Gerda repeated the Lord's Prayer. The cold was so intense that\\r\\nshe could see her own breath, which came like smoke out of her mouth. It\\r\\ngrew thicker and thicker, and took the form of little angels, that grew\\r\\nmore and more when they touched the earth. All had helms on their heads,\\r\\nand lances and shields in their hands; they increased in numbers; and\\r\\nwhen Gerda had finished the Lord's Prayer, she was surrounded by a whole\\r\\nlegion. They thrust at the horrid snow-flakes with their spears, so that\\r\\nthey flew into a thousand pieces; and little Gerda walked on bravely and\\r\\nin security. The angels patted her hands and feet; and then she felt the\\r\\ncold less, and went on quickly towards the palace of the Snow Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now we shall see how Kay fared. He never thought of Gerda, and least\\r\\nof all that she was standing before the palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSEVENTH STORY. What Took Place in the Palace of the Snow Queen, and what\\r\\nHappened Afterward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe walls of the palace were of driving snow, and the windows and doors\\r\\nof cutting winds. There were more than a hundred halls there, according\\r\\nas the snow was driven by the winds. The largest was many miles in\\r\\nextent; all were lighted up by the powerful Aurora Borealis, and all\\r\\nwere so large, so empty, so icy cold, and so resplendent! Mirth never\\r\\nreigned there; there was never even a little bear-ball, with the storm\\r\\nfor music, while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off\\r\\ntheir steps. Never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes; vast,\\r\\ncold, and empty were the halls of the Snow Queen. The northern-lights\\r\\nshone with such precision that one could tell exactly when they were\\r\\nat their highest or lowest degree of brightness. In the middle of the\\r\\nempty, endless hall of snow, was a frozen lake; it was cracked in a\\r\\nthousand pieces, but each piece was so like the other, that it seemed\\r\\nthe work of a cunning artificer. In the middle of this lake sat the Snow\\r\\nQueen when she was at home; and then she said she was sitting in the\\r\\nMirror of Understanding, and that this was the only one and the best\\r\\nthing in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Kay was quite blue, yes nearly black with cold; but he did not\\r\\nobserve it, for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body,\\r\\nand his heart was a lump of ice. He was dragging along some pointed\\r\\nflat pieces of ice, which he laid together in all possible ways, for he\\r\\nwanted to make something with them; just as we have little flat pieces\\r\\nof wood to make geometrical figures with, called the Chinese Puzzle.\\r\\nKay made all sorts of figures, the most complicated, for it was\\r\\nan ice-puzzle for the understanding. In his eyes the figures were\\r\\nextraordinarily beautiful, and of the utmost importance; for the bit\\r\\nof glass which was in his eye caused this. He found whole figures which\\r\\nrepresented a written word; but he never could manage to represent just\\r\\nthe word he wanted--that word was “eternity”; and the Snow Queen had\\r\\nsaid, “If you can discover that figure, you shall be your own master,\\r\\nand I will make you a present of the whole world and a pair of new\\r\\nskates.” But he could not find it out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am going now to warm lands,” said the Snow Queen. “I must have a look\\r\\ndown into the black caldrons.” It was the volcanoes Vesuvius and Etna\\r\\nthat she meant. “I will just give them a coating of white, for that is\\r\\nas it ought to be; besides, it is good for the oranges and the grapes.”\\r\\n And then away she flew, and Kay sat quite alone in the empty halls of\\r\\nice that were miles long, and looked at the blocks of ice, and thought\\r\\nand thought till his skull was almost cracked. There he sat quite\\r\\nbenumbed and motionless; one would have imagined he was frozen to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly little Gerda stepped through the great portal into the palace.\\r\\nThe gate was formed of cutting winds; but Gerda repeated her evening\\r\\nprayer, and the winds were laid as though they slept; and the little\\r\\nmaiden entered the vast, empty, cold halls. There she beheld Kay: she\\r\\nrecognised him, flew to embrace him, and cried out, her arms firmly\\r\\nholding him the while, “Kay, sweet little Kay! Have I then found you at\\r\\nlast?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he sat quite still, benumbed and cold. Then little Gerda shed\\r\\nburning tears; and they fell on his bosom, they penetrated to his\\r\\nheart, they thawed the lumps of ice, and consumed the splinters of the\\r\\nlooking-glass; he looked at her, and she sang the hymn:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there\\r\\nthe children to greet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHereupon Kay burst into tears; he wept so much that the splinter rolled\\r\\nout of his eye, and he recognised her, and shouted, “Gerda, sweet little\\r\\nGerda! Where have you been so long? And where have I been?” He looked\\r\\nround him. “How cold it is here!” said he. “How empty and cold!” And he\\r\\nheld fast by Gerda, who laughed and wept for joy. It was so beautiful,\\r\\nthat even the blocks of ice danced about for joy; and when they were\\r\\ntired and laid themselves down, they formed exactly the letters which\\r\\nthe Snow Queen had told him to find out; so now he was his own master,\\r\\nand he would have the whole world and a pair of new skates into the\\r\\nbargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerda kissed his cheeks, and they grew quite blooming; she kissed his\\r\\neyes, and they shone like her own; she kissed his hands and feet, and he\\r\\nwas again well and merry. The Snow Queen might come back as soon as she\\r\\nliked; there stood his discharge written in resplendent masses of ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took each other by the hand, and wandered forth out of the large\\r\\nhall; they talked of their old grandmother, and of the roses upon the\\r\\nroof; and wherever they went, the winds ceased raging, and the sun burst\\r\\nforth. And when they reached the bush with the red berries, they found\\r\\nthe Reindeer waiting for them. He had brought another, a young one, with\\r\\nhim, whose udder was filled with milk, which he gave to the little ones,\\r\\nand kissed their lips. They then carried Kay and Gerda--first to the\\r\\nFinland woman, where they warmed themselves in the warm room, and\\r\\nlearned what they were to do on their journey home; and they went to\\r\\nthe Lapland woman, who made some new clothes for them and repaired their\\r\\nsledges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reindeer and the young hind leaped along beside them, and\\r\\naccompanied them to the boundary of the country. Here the first\\r\\nvegetation peeped forth; here Kay and Gerda took leave of the Lapland\\r\\nwoman. “Farewell! Farewell!” they all said. And the first green buds\\r\\nappeared, the first little birds began to chirrup; and out of the wood\\r\\ncame, riding on a magnificent horse, which Gerda knew (it was one of the\\r\\nleaders in the golden carriage), a young damsel with a bright-red cap on\\r\\nher head, and armed with pistols. It was the little robber maiden, who,\\r\\ntired of being at home, had determined to make a journey to the north;\\r\\nand afterwards in another direction, if that did not please her. She\\r\\nrecognised Gerda immediately, and Gerda knew her too. It was a joyful\\r\\nmeeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a fine fellow for tramping about,” said she to little Kay; “I\\r\\nshould like to know, faith, if you deserve that one should run from one\\r\\nend of the world to the other for your sake?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Gerda patted her cheeks, and inquired for the Prince and Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are gone abroad,” said the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the Raven?” asked little Gerda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! The Raven is dead,” she answered. “His tame sweetheart is a\\r\\nwidow, and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg; she laments most\\r\\npiteously, but it's all mere talk and stuff! Now tell me what you've\\r\\nbeen doing and how you managed to catch him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Gerda and Kay both told their story.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd “Schnipp-schnapp-schnurre-basselurre,” said the robber maiden; and\\r\\nshe took the hands of each, and promised that if she should some day\\r\\npass through the town where they lived, she would come and visit them;\\r\\nand then away she rode. Kay and Gerda took each other's hand: it was\\r\\nlovely spring weather, with abundance of flowers and of verdure. The\\r\\nchurch-bells rang, and the children recognised the high towers, and the\\r\\nlarge town; it was that in which they dwelt. They entered and hastened\\r\\nup to their grandmother's room, where everything was standing as\\r\\nformerly. The clock said “tick! tack!” and the finger moved round; but\\r\\nas they entered, they remarked that they were now grown up. The roses\\r\\non the leads hung blooming in at the open window; there stood the little\\r\\nchildren's chairs, and Kay and Gerda sat down on them, holding each\\r\\nother by the hand; they both had forgotten the cold empty splendor of\\r\\nthe Snow Queen, as though it had been a dream. The grandmother sat in\\r\\nthe bright sunshine, and read aloud from the Bible: “Unless ye become as\\r\\nlittle children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Kay and Gerda looked in each other's eyes, and all at once they\\r\\nunderstood the old hymn:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there\\r\\nthe children to greet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere sat the two grown-up persons; grown-up, and yet children; children\\r\\nat least in heart; and it was summer-time; summer, glorious summer!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LEAP-FROG\\r\\n\\r\\nA Flea, a Grasshopper, and a Leap-frog once wanted to see which could\\r\\njump highest; and they invited the whole world, and everybody else\\r\\nbesides who chose to come to see the festival. Three famous jumpers were\\r\\nthey, as everyone would say, when they all met together in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will give my daughter to him who jumps highest,” exclaimed the King;\\r\\n“for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump for.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flea was the first to step forward. He had exquisite manners, and\\r\\nbowed to the company on all sides; for he had noble blood, and was,\\r\\nmoreover, accustomed to the society of man alone; and that makes a great\\r\\ndifference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the Grasshopper. He was considerably heavier, but he was\\r\\nwell-mannered, and wore a green uniform, which he had by right of birth;\\r\\nhe said, moreover, that he belonged to a very ancient Egyptian family,\\r\\nand that in the house where he then was, he was thought much of. The\\r\\nfact was, he had been just brought out of the fields, and put in a\\r\\npasteboard house, three stories high, all made of court-cards, with the\\r\\ncolored side inwards; and doors and windows cut out of the body of\\r\\nthe Queen of Hearts. “I sing so well,” said he, “that sixteen native\\r\\ngrasshoppers who have chirped from infancy, and yet got no house built\\r\\nof cards to live in, grew thinner than they were before for sheer\\r\\nvexation when they heard me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was thus that the Flea and the Grasshopper gave an account of\\r\\nthemselves, and thought they were quite good enough to marry a Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Leap-frog said nothing; but people gave it as their opinion, that\\r\\nhe therefore thought the more; and when the housedog snuffed at him\\r\\nwith his nose, he confessed the Leap-frog was of good family. The old\\r\\ncouncillor, who had had three orders given him to make him hold his\\r\\ntongue, asserted that the Leap-frog was a prophet; for that one could\\r\\nsee on his back, if there would be a severe or mild winter, and that\\r\\nwas what one could not see even on the back of the man who writes the\\r\\nalmanac.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say nothing, it is true,” exclaimed the King; “but I have my own\\r\\nopinion, notwithstanding.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the trial was to take place. The Flea jumped so high that nobody\\r\\ncould see where he went to; so they all asserted he had not jumped at\\r\\nall; and that was dishonorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grasshopper jumped only half as high; but he leaped into the King's\\r\\nface, who said that was ill-mannered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Leap-frog stood still for a long time lost in thought; it was\\r\\nbelieved at last he would not jump at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I only hope he is not unwell,” said the house-dog; when, pop! he made a\\r\\njump all on one side into the lap of the Princess, who was sitting on a\\r\\nlittle golden stool close by.\\r\\n\\r\\nHereupon the King said, “There is nothing above my daughter; therefore\\r\\nto bound up to her is the highest jump that can be made; but for this,\\r\\none must possess understanding, and the Leap-frog has shown that he has\\r\\nunderstanding. He is brave and intellectual.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so he won the Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It's all the same to me,” said the Flea. “She may have the old\\r\\nLeap-frog, for all I care. I jumped the highest; but in this world\\r\\nmerit seldom meets its reward. A fine exterior is what people look at\\r\\nnow-a-days.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flea then went into foreign service, where, it is said, he was\\r\\nkilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grasshopper sat without on a green bank, and reflected on worldly\\r\\nthings; and he said too, “Yes, a fine exterior is everything--a fine\\r\\nexterior is what people care about.” And then he began chirping his\\r\\npeculiar melancholy song, from which we have taken this history; and\\r\\nwhich may, very possibly, be all untrue, although it does stand here\\r\\nprinted in black and white.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ELDERBUSH\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a little boy who had taken cold. He had\\r\\ngone out and got his feet wet; though nobody could imagine how it had\\r\\nhappened, for it was quite dry weather. So his mother undressed him, put\\r\\nhim to bed, and had the tea-pot brought in, to make him a good cup of\\r\\nElderflower tea. Just at that moment the merry old man came in who\\r\\nlived up a-top of the house all alone; for he had neither wife nor\\r\\nchildren--but he liked children very much, and knew so many fairy tales,\\r\\nthat it was quite delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now drink your tea,” said the boy's mother; “then, perhaps, you may\\r\\nhear a fairy tale.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I had but something new to tell,” said the old man. “But how did the\\r\\nchild get his feet wet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is the very thing that nobody can make out,” said his mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Am I to hear a fairy tale?” asked the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, if you can tell me exactly--for I must know that first--how deep\\r\\nthe gutter is in the little street opposite, that you pass through in\\r\\ngoing to school.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just up to the middle of my boot,” said the child; “but then I must go\\r\\ninto the deep hole.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, ah! That's where the wet feet came from,” said the old man. “I\\r\\nought now to tell you a story; but I don't know any more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can make one in a moment,” said the little boy. “My mother says\\r\\nthat all you look at can be turned into a fairy tale: and that you can\\r\\nfind a story in everything.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but such tales and stories are good for nothing. The right sort\\r\\ncome of themselves; they tap at my forehead and say, 'Here we are.'”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Won't there be a tap soon?” asked the little boy. And his mother\\r\\nlaughed, put some Elder-flowers in the tea-pot, and poured boiling water\\r\\nupon them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do tell me something! Pray do!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, if a fairy tale would come of its own accord; but they are proud\\r\\nand haughty, and come only when they choose. Stop!” said he, all on a\\r\\nsudden. “I have it! Pay attention! There is one in the tea-pot!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the little boy looked at the tea-pot. The cover rose more and more;\\r\\nand the Elder-flowers came forth so fresh and white, and shot up long\\r\\nbranches. Out of the spout even did they spread themselves on all sides,\\r\\nand grew larger and larger; it was a splendid Elderbush, a whole tree;\\r\\nand it reached into the very bed, and pushed the curtains aside. How\\r\\nit bloomed! And what an odour! In the middle of the bush sat a\\r\\nfriendly-looking old woman in a most strange dress. It was quite\\r\\ngreen, like the leaves of the elder, and was trimmed with large white\\r\\nElder-flowers; so that at first one could not tell whether it was a\\r\\nstuff, or a natural green and real flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What's that woman's name?” asked the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Greeks and Romans,” said the old man, “called her a Dryad; but that\\r\\nwe do not understand. The people who live in the New Booths [*] have a much\\r\\nbetter name for her; they call her 'old Granny'--and she it is to\\r\\nwhom you are to pay attention. Now listen, and look at the beautiful\\r\\nElderbush.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * A row of buildings for seamen in Copenhagen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just such another large blooming Elder Tree stands near the New Booths.\\r\\nIt grew there in the corner of a little miserable court-yard; and under\\r\\nit sat, of an afternoon, in the most splendid sunshine, two old\\r\\npeople; an old, old seaman, and his old, old wife. They had\\r\\ngreat-grand-children, and were soon to celebrate the fiftieth\\r\\nanniversary of their marriage; but they could not exactly recollect the\\r\\ndate: and old Granny sat in the tree, and looked as pleased as now. 'I\\r\\nknow the date,' said she; but those below did not hear her, for they\\r\\nwere talking about old times.\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes, can't you remember when we were very little,' said the old\\r\\nseaman, 'and ran and played about? It was the very same court-yard where\\r\\nwe now are, and we stuck slips in the ground, and made a garden.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'I remember it well,' said the old woman; 'I remember it quite well. We\\r\\nwatered the slips, and one of them was an Elderbush. It took root, put\\r\\nforth green shoots, and grew up to be the large tree under which we old\\r\\nfolks are now sitting.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'To be sure,' said he. 'And there in the corner stood a waterpail,\\r\\nwhere I used to swim my boats.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'True; but first we went to school to learn somewhat,' said she; 'and\\r\\nthen we were confirmed. We both cried; but in the afternoon we went up\\r\\nthe Round Tower, and looked down on Copenhagen, and far, far away over\\r\\nthe water; then we went to Friedericksberg, where the King and the Queen\\r\\nwere sailing about in their splendid barges.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'But I had a different sort of sailing to that, later; and that, too,\\r\\nfor many a year; a long way off, on great voyages.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes, many a time have I wept for your sake,' said she. 'I thought you\\r\\nwere dead and gone, and lying down in the deep waters. Many a night have\\r\\nI got up to see if the wind had not changed: and changed it had, sure\\r\\nenough; but you never came. I remember so well one day, when the rain\\r\\nwas pouring down in torrents, the scavengers were before the house where\\r\\nI was in service, and I had come up with the dust, and remained standing\\r\\nat the door--it was dreadful weather--when just as I was there, the\\r\\npostman came and gave me a letter. It was from you! What a tour that\\r\\nletter had made! I opened it instantly and read: I laughed and wept.\\r\\nI was so happy. In it I read that you were in warm lands where the\\r\\ncoffee-tree grows. What a blessed land that must be! You related so\\r\\nmuch, and I saw it all the while the rain was pouring down, and I\\r\\nstanding there with the dust-box. At the same moment came someone who\\r\\nembraced me.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes; but you gave him a good box on his ear that made it tingle!'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'But I did not know it was you. You arrived as soon as your letter,\\r\\nand you were so handsome--that you still are--and had a long yellow silk\\r\\nhandkerchief round your neck, and a bran new hat on; oh, you were so\\r\\ndashing! Good heavens! What weather it was, and what a state the street\\r\\nwas in!'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'And then we married,' said he. 'Don't you remember? And then we\\r\\nhad our first little boy, and then Mary, and Nicholas, and Peter, and\\r\\nChristian.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes, and how they all grew up to be honest people, and were beloved by\\r\\neverybody.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'And their children also have children,' said the old sailor; 'yes,\\r\\nthose are our grand-children, full of strength and vigor. It was,\\r\\nmethinks about this season that we had our wedding.'\\r\\n\\r\\n“'Yes, this very day is the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage,' said\\r\\nold Granny, sticking her head between the two old people; who thought\\r\\nit was their neighbor who nodded to them. They looked at each other and\\r\\nheld one another by the hand. Soon after came their children, and their\\r\\ngrand-children; for they knew well enough that it was the day of the\\r\\nfiftieth anniversary, and had come with their gratulations that very\\r\\nmorning; but the old people had forgotten it, although they were able\\r\\nto remember all that had happened many years ago. And the Elderbush sent\\r\\nforth a strong odour in the sun, that was just about to set, and shone\\r\\nright in the old people's faces. They both looked so rosy-cheeked; and\\r\\nthe youngest of the grandchildren danced around them, and called out\\r\\nquite delighted, that there was to be something very splendid that\\r\\nevening--they were all to have hot potatoes. And old Nanny nodded in the\\r\\nbush, and shouted 'hurrah!' with the rest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But that is no fairy tale,” said the little boy, who was listening to\\r\\nthe story.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The thing is, you must understand it,” said the narrator; “let us ask\\r\\nold Nanny.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was no fairy tale, 'tis true,” said old Nanny; “but now it's\\r\\ncoming. The most wonderful fairy tales grow out of that which is\\r\\nreality; were that not the case, you know, my magnificent Elderbush\\r\\ncould not have grown out of the tea-pot.” And then she took the little\\r\\nboy out of bed, laid him on her bosom, and the branches of the Elder\\r\\nTree, full of flowers, closed around her. They sat in an aerial\\r\\ndwelling, and it flew with them through the air. Oh, it was wondrous\\r\\nbeautiful! Old Nanny had grown all of a sudden a young and pretty\\r\\nmaiden; but her robe was still the same green stuff with white flowers,\\r\\nwhich she had worn before. On her bosom she had a real Elderflower,\\r\\nand in her yellow waving hair a wreath of the flowers; her eyes were so\\r\\nlarge and blue that it was a pleasure to look at them; she kissed the\\r\\nboy, and now they were of the same age and felt alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nHand in hand they went out of the bower, and they were standing in the\\r\\nbeautiful garden of their home. Near the green lawn papa's walking-stick\\r\\nwas tied, and for the little ones it seemed to be endowed with life; for\\r\\nas soon as they got astride it, the round polished knob was turned into\\r\\na magnificent neighing head, a long black mane fluttered in the breeze,\\r\\nand four slender yet strong legs shot out. The animal was strong and\\r\\nhandsome, and away they went at full gallop round the lawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Huzza! Now we are riding miles off,” said the boy. “We are riding away\\r\\nto the castle where we were last year!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on they rode round the grass-plot; and the little maiden, who, we\\r\\nknow, was no one else but old Nanny, kept on crying out, “Now we are in\\r\\nthe country! Don't you see the farm-house yonder? And there is an Elder\\r\\nTree standing beside it; and the cock is scraping away the earth for the\\r\\nhens, look, how he struts! And now we are close to the church. It lies\\r\\nhigh upon the hill, between the large oak-trees, one of which is half\\r\\ndecayed. And now we are by the smithy, where the fire is blazing, and\\r\\nwhere the half-naked men are banging with their hammers till the sparks\\r\\nfly about. Away! away! To the beautiful country-seat!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all that the little maiden, who sat behind on the stick, spoke of,\\r\\nflew by in reality. The boy saw it all, and yet they were only going\\r\\nround the grass-plot. Then they played in a side avenue, and marked out\\r\\na little garden on the earth; and they took Elder-blossoms from their\\r\\nhair, planted them, and they grew just like those the old people planted\\r\\nwhen they were children, as related before. They went hand in hand, as\\r\\nthe old people had done when they were children; but not to the Round\\r\\nTower, or to Friedericksberg; no, the little damsel wound her arms round\\r\\nthe boy, and then they flew far away through all Denmark. And spring\\r\\ncame, and summer; and then it was autumn, and then winter; and a\\r\\nthousand pictures were reflected in the eye and in the heart of the boy;\\r\\nand the little girl always sang to him, “This you will never forget.”\\r\\n And during their whole flight the Elder Tree smelt so sweet and odorous;\\r\\nhe remarked the roses and the fresh beeches, but the Elder Tree had\\r\\na more wondrous fragrance, for its flowers hung on the breast of the\\r\\nlittle maiden; and there, too, did he often lay his head during the\\r\\nflight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is lovely here in spring!” said the young maiden. And they stood in\\r\\na beech-wood that had just put on its first green, where the woodroof [*]\\r\\nat their feet sent forth its fragrance, and the pale-red anemony looked\\r\\nso pretty among the verdure. “Oh, would it were always spring in the\\r\\nsweetly-smelling Danish beech-forests!”\\r\\n\\r\\n     * Asperula odorata.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is lovely here in summer!” said she. And she flew past old castles\\r\\nof by-gone days of chivalry, where the red walls and the embattled\\r\\ngables were mirrored in the canal, where the swans were swimming, and\\r\\npeered up into the old cool avenues. In the fields the corn was waving\\r\\nlike the sea; in the ditches red and yellow flowers were growing; while\\r\\nwild-drone flowers, and blooming convolvuluses were creeping in the\\r\\nhedges; and towards evening the moon rose round and large, and the\\r\\nhaycocks in the meadows smelt so sweetly. “This one never forgets!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is lovely here in autumn!” said the little maiden. And suddenly the\\r\\natmosphere grew as blue again as before; the forest grew red, and green,\\r\\nand yellow-colored. The dogs came leaping along, and whole flocks of\\r\\nwild-fowl flew over the cairn, where blackberry-bushes were hanging\\r\\nround the old stones. The sea was dark blue, covered with ships full\\r\\nof white sails; and in the barn old women, maidens, and children were\\r\\nsitting picking hops into a large cask; the young sang songs, but the\\r\\nold told fairy tales of mountain-sprites and soothsayers. Nothing could\\r\\nbe more charming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is delightful here in winter!” said the little maiden. And all the\\r\\ntrees were covered with hoar-frost; they looked like white corals; the\\r\\nsnow crackled under foot, as if one had new boots on; and one falling\\r\\nstar after the other was seen in the sky. The Christmas-tree was lighted\\r\\nin the room; presents were there, and good-humor reigned. In the country\\r\\nthe violin sounded in the room of the peasant; the newly-baked cakes\\r\\nwere attacked; even the poorest child said, “It is really delightful\\r\\nhere in winter!”\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, it was delightful; and the little maiden showed the boy everything;\\r\\nand the Elder Tree still was fragrant, and the red flag, with the white\\r\\ncross, was still waving: the flag under which the old seaman in the New\\r\\nBooths had sailed. And the boy grew up to be a lad, and was to go forth\\r\\nin the wide world-far, far away to warm lands, where the coffee-tree\\r\\ngrows; but at his departure the little maiden took an Elder-blossom from\\r\\nher bosom, and gave it him to keep; and it was placed between the leaves\\r\\nof his Prayer-Book; and when in foreign lands he opened the book, it\\r\\nwas always at the place where the keepsake-flower lay; and the more he\\r\\nlooked at it, the fresher it became; he felt as it were, the fragrance\\r\\nof the Danish groves; and from among the leaves of the flowers he could\\r\\ndistinctly see the little maiden, peeping forth with her bright blue\\r\\neyes--and then she whispered, “It is delightful here in Spring, Summer,\\r\\nAutumn, and Winter”; and a hundred visions glided before his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus passed many years, and he was now an old man, and sat with his old\\r\\nwife under the blooming tree. They held each other by the hand, as the\\r\\nold grand-father and grand-mother yonder in the New Booths did, and they\\r\\ntalked exactly like them of old times, and of the fiftieth anniversary\\r\\nof their wedding. The little maiden, with the blue eyes, and with\\r\\nElder-blossoms in her hair, sat in the tree, nodded to both of them,\\r\\nand said, “To-day is the fiftieth anniversary!” And then she took two\\r\\nflowers out of her hair, and kissed them. First, they shone like silver,\\r\\nthen like gold; and when they laid them on the heads of the old people,\\r\\neach flower became a golden crown. So there they both sat, like a king\\r\\nand a queen, under the fragrant tree, that looked exactly like an elder:\\r\\nthe old man told his wife the story of “Old Nanny,” as it had been told\\r\\nhim when a boy. And it seemed to both of them it contained much that\\r\\nresembled their own history; and those parts that were like it pleased\\r\\nthem best.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thus it is,” said the little maiden in the tree, “some call me 'Old\\r\\nNanny,' others a 'Dryad,' but, in reality, my name is 'Remembrance';\\r\\n'tis I who sit in the tree that grows and grows! I can remember; I can\\r\\ntell things! Let me see if you have my flower still?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the old man opened his Prayer-Book. There lay the Elder-blossom,\\r\\nas fresh as if it had been placed there but a short time before; and\\r\\nRemembrance nodded, and the old people, decked with crowns of gold, sat\\r\\nin the flush of the evening sun. They closed their eyes, and--and--!\\r\\nYes, that's the end of the story!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boy lay in his bed; he did not know if he had dreamed or\\r\\nnot, or if he had been listening while someone told him the story. The\\r\\ntea-pot was standing on the table, but no Elder Tree was growing out\\r\\nof it! And the old man, who had been talking, was just on the point of\\r\\ngoing out at the door, and he did go.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How splendid that was!” said the little boy. “Mother, I have been to\\r\\nwarm countries.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I should think,” said his mother. “When one has drunk two good\\r\\ncupfuls of Elder-flower tea, 'tis likely enough one goes into warm\\r\\nclimates”; and she tucked him up nicely, least he should take cold. “You\\r\\nhave had a good sleep while I have been sitting here, and arguing with\\r\\nhim whether it was a story or a fairy tale.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And where is old Nanny?” asked the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the tea-pot,” said his mother; “and there she may remain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BELL\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople said “The Evening Bell is sounding, the sun is setting.” For a\\r\\nstrange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town.\\r\\nIt was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a\\r\\nmoment, for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude\\r\\nmade too great a noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose persons who were walking outside the town, where the houses were\\r\\nfarther apart, with gardens or little fields between them, could see\\r\\nthe evening sky still better, and heard the sound of the bell much\\r\\nmore distinctly. It was as if the tones came from a church in the still\\r\\nforest; people looked thitherward, and felt their minds attuned most\\r\\nsolemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time passed, and people said to each other--“I wonder if there\\r\\nis a church out in the wood? The bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet;\\r\\nlet us stroll thither, and examine the matter nearer.” And the rich\\r\\npeople drove out, and the poor walked, but the way seemed strangely\\r\\nlong to them; and when they came to a clump of willows which grew on the\\r\\nskirts of the forest, they sat down, and looked up at the long\\r\\nbranches, and fancied they were now in the depth of the green wood. The\\r\\nconfectioner of the town came out, and set up his booth there; and soon\\r\\nafter came another confectioner, who hung a bell over his stand, as\\r\\na sign or ornament, but it had no clapper, and it was tarred over to\\r\\npreserve it from the rain. When all the people returned home, they said\\r\\nit had been very romantic, and that it was quite a different sort of\\r\\nthing to a pic-nic or tea-party. There were three persons who asserted\\r\\nthey had penetrated to the end of the forest, and that they had always\\r\\nheard the wonderful sounds of the bell, but it had seemed to them as if\\r\\nit had come from the town. One wrote a whole poem about it, and said the\\r\\nbell sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child, and\\r\\nthat no melody was sweeter than the tones of the bell. The king of the\\r\\ncountry was also observant of it, and vowed that he who could discover\\r\\nwhence the sounds proceeded, should have the title of “Universal\\r\\nBell-ringer,” even if it were not really a bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany persons now went to the wood, for the sake of getting the place,\\r\\nbut one only returned with a sort of explanation; for nobody went far\\r\\nenough, that one not further than the others. However, he said that\\r\\nthe sound proceeded from a very large owl, in a hollow tree; a sort of\\r\\nlearned owl, that continually knocked its head against the branches. But\\r\\nwhether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree, that no\\r\\none could say with certainty. So now he got the place of “Universal\\r\\nBell-ringer,” and wrote yearly a short treatise “On the Owl”; but\\r\\neverybody was just as wise as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the day of confirmation. The clergyman had spoken so touchingly,\\r\\nthe children who were confirmed had been greatly moved; it was\\r\\nan eventful day for them; from children they become all at once\\r\\ngrown-up-persons; it was as if their infant souls were now to fly all\\r\\nat once into persons with more understanding. The sun was shining\\r\\ngloriously; the children that had been confirmed went out of the town;\\r\\nand from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell\\r\\nwith wonderful distinctness. They all immediately felt a wish to go\\r\\nthither; all except three. One of them had to go home to try on a\\r\\nball-dress; for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her\\r\\nto be confirmed this time, for otherwise she would not have come;\\r\\nthe other was a poor boy, who had borrowed his coat and boots to be\\r\\nconfirmed in from the innkeeper's son, and he was to give them back by\\r\\na certain hour; the third said that he never went to a strange place\\r\\nif his parents were not with him--that he had always been a good boy\\r\\nhitherto, and would still be so now that he was confirmed, and that one\\r\\nought not to laugh at him for it: the others, however, did make fun of\\r\\nhim, after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three, therefore, that did not go; the others hastened on.\\r\\nThe sun shone, the birds sang, and the children sang too, and each held\\r\\nthe other by the hand; for as yet they had none of them any high office,\\r\\nand were all of equal rank in the eye of God.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut two of the youngest soon grew tired, and both returned to town; two\\r\\nlittle girls sat down, and twined garlands, so they did not go either;\\r\\nand when the others reached the willow-tree, where the confectioner was,\\r\\nthey said, “Now we are there! In reality the bell does not exist; it is\\r\\nonly a fancy that people have taken into their heads!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same moment the bell sounded deep in the wood, so clear and\\r\\nsolemnly that five or six determined to penetrate somewhat further. It\\r\\nwas so thick, and the foliage so dense, that it was quite fatiguing\\r\\nto proceed. Woodroof and anemonies grew almost too high; blooming\\r\\nconvolvuluses and blackberry-bushes hung in long garlands from tree to\\r\\ntree, where the nightingale sang and the sunbeams were playing: it was\\r\\nvery beautiful, but it was no place for girls to go; their clothes would\\r\\nget so torn. Large blocks of stone lay there, overgrown with moss of\\r\\nevery color; the fresh spring bubbled forth, and made a strange gurgling\\r\\nsound.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That surely cannot be the bell,” said one of the children, lying down\\r\\nand listening. “This must be looked to.” So he remained, and let the\\r\\nothers go on without him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey afterwards came to a little house, made of branches and the bark of\\r\\ntrees; a large wild apple-tree bent over it, as if it would shower down\\r\\nall its blessings on the roof, where roses were blooming. The long stems\\r\\ntwined round the gable, on which there hung a small bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas it that which people had heard? Yes, everybody was unanimous on the\\r\\nsubject, except one, who said that the bell was too small and too fine\\r\\nto be heard at so great a distance, and besides it was very different\\r\\ntones to those that could move a human heart in such a manner. It was a\\r\\nking's son who spoke; whereon the others said, “Such people always want\\r\\nto be wiser than everybody else.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now let him go on alone; and as he went, his breast was filled more\\r\\nand more with the forest solitude; but he still heard the little bell\\r\\nwith which the others were so satisfied, and now and then, when the\\r\\nwind blew, he could also hear the people singing who were sitting at tea\\r\\nwhere the confectioner had his tent; but the deep sound of the bell rose\\r\\nlouder; it was almost as if an organ were accompanying it, and the tones\\r\\ncame from the left hand, the side where the heart is placed. A rustling\\r\\nwas heard in the bushes, and a little boy stood before the King's Son, a\\r\\nboy in wooden shoes, and with so short a jacket that one could see what\\r\\nlong wrists he had. Both knew each other: the boy was that one among\\r\\nthe children who could not come because he had to go home and return his\\r\\njacket and boots to the innkeeper's son. This he had done, and was now\\r\\ngoing on in wooden shoes and in his humble dress, for the bell sounded\\r\\nwith so deep a tone, and with such strange power, that proceed he must.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, then, we can go together,” said the King's Son. But the poor\\r\\nchild that had been confirmed was quite ashamed; he looked at his wooden\\r\\nshoes, pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket, and said that he was\\r\\nafraid he could not walk so fast; besides, he thought that the bell must\\r\\nbe looked for to the right; for that was the place where all sorts of\\r\\nbeautiful things were to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But there we shall not meet,” said the King's Son, nodding at the same\\r\\ntime to the poor boy, who went into the darkest, thickest part of the\\r\\nwood, where thorns tore his humble dress, and scratched his face and\\r\\nhands and feet till they bled. The King's Son got some scratches too;\\r\\nbut the sun shone on his path, and it is him that we will follow, for he\\r\\nwas an excellent and resolute youth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must and will find the bell,” said he, “even if I am obliged to go to\\r\\nthe end of the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ugly apes sat upon the trees, and grinned. “Shall we thrash him?”\\r\\n said they. “Shall we thrash him? He is the son of a king!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on he went, without being disheartened, deeper and deeper into the\\r\\nwood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing. There stood white\\r\\nlilies with blood-red stamina, skyblue tulips, which shone as they waved\\r\\nin the winds, and apple-trees, the apples of which looked exactly like\\r\\nlarge soapbubbles: so only think how the trees must have sparkled in the\\r\\nsunshine! Around the nicest green meads, where the deer were playing in\\r\\nthe grass, grew magnificent oaks and beeches; and if the bark of one of\\r\\nthe trees was cracked, there grass and long creeping plants grew in\\r\\nthe crevices. And there were large calm lakes there too, in which white\\r\\nswans were swimming, and beat the air with their wings. The King's Son\\r\\noften stood still and listened. He thought the bell sounded from the\\r\\ndepths of these still lakes; but then he remarked again that the tone\\r\\nproceeded not from there, but farther off, from out the depths of the\\r\\nforest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun now set: the atmosphere glowed like fire. It was still in the\\r\\nwoods, so very still; and he fell on his knees, sung his evening hymn,\\r\\nand said: “I cannot find what I seek; the sun is going down, and night\\r\\nis coming--the dark, dark night. Yet perhaps I may be able once more\\r\\nto see the round red sun before he entirely disappears. I will climb up\\r\\nyonder rock.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he seized hold of the creeping-plants, and the roots of\\r\\ntrees--climbed up the moist stones where the water-snakes were writhing\\r\\nand the toads were croaking--and he gained the summit before the sun\\r\\nhad quite gone down. How magnificent was the sight from this height! The\\r\\nsea--the great, the glorious sea, that dashed its long waves against the\\r\\ncoast--was stretched out before him. And yonder, where sea and sky meet,\\r\\nstood the sun, like a large shining altar, all melted together in the\\r\\nmost glowing colors. And the wood and the sea sang a song of rejoicing,\\r\\nand his heart sang with the rest: all nature was a vast holy church,\\r\\nin which the trees and the buoyant clouds were the pillars, flowers and\\r\\ngrass the velvet carpeting, and heaven itself the large cupola. The red\\r\\ncolors above faded away as the sun vanished, but a million stars were\\r\\nlighted, a million lamps shone; and the King's Son spread out his arms\\r\\ntowards heaven, and wood, and sea; when at the same moment, coming by\\r\\na path to the right, appeared, in his wooden shoes and jacket, the poor\\r\\nboy who had been confirmed with him. He had followed his own path, and\\r\\nhad reached the spot just as soon as the son of the king had done. They\\r\\nran towards each other, and stood together hand in hand in the vast\\r\\nchurch of nature and of poetry, while over them sounded the invisible\\r\\nholy bell: blessed spirits floated around them, and lifted up their\\r\\nvoices in a rejoicing hallelujah!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OLD HOUSE\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the street, up there, was an old, a very old house--it was almost\\r\\nthree hundred years old, for that might be known by reading the great\\r\\nbeam on which the date of the year was carved: together with tulips and\\r\\nhop-binds there were whole verses spelled as in former times, and over\\r\\nevery window was a distorted face cut out in the beam. The one story\\r\\nstood forward a great way over the other; and directly under the eaves\\r\\nwas a leaden spout with a dragon's head; the rain-water should have run\\r\\nout of the mouth, but it ran out of the belly, for there was a hole in\\r\\nthe spout.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the other houses in the street were so new and so neat, with large\\r\\nwindow panes and smooth walls, one could easily see that they would have\\r\\nnothing to do with the old house: they certainly thought, “How long is\\r\\nthat old decayed thing to stand here as a spectacle in the street? And\\r\\nthen the projecting windows stand so far out, that no one can see from\\r\\nour windows what happens in that direction! The steps are as broad as\\r\\nthose of a palace, and as high as to a church tower. The iron railings\\r\\nlook just like the door to an old family vault, and then they have brass\\r\\ntops--that's so stupid!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side of the street were also new and neat houses, and they\\r\\nthought just as the others did; but at the window opposite the old house\\r\\nthere sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks and bright beaming eyes:\\r\\nhe certainly liked the old house best, and that both in sunshine and\\r\\nmoonshine. And when he looked across at the wall where the mortar\\r\\nhad fallen out, he could sit and find out there the strangest figures\\r\\nimaginable; exactly as the street had appeared before, with steps,\\r\\nprojecting windows, and pointed gables; he could see soldiers with\\r\\nhalberds, and spouts where the water ran, like dragons and serpents.\\r\\nThat was a house to look at; and there lived an old man, who wore plush\\r\\nbreeches; and he had a coat with large brass buttons, and a wig that one\\r\\ncould see was a real wig. Every morning there came an old fellow to him\\r\\nwho put his rooms in order, and went on errands; otherwise, the old man\\r\\nin the plush breeches was quite alone in the old house. Now and then he\\r\\ncame to the window and looked out, and the little boy nodded to him,\\r\\nand the old man nodded again, and so they became acquaintances, and then\\r\\nthey were friends, although they had never spoken to each other--but\\r\\nthat made no difference. The little boy heard his parents say, “The old\\r\\nman opposite is very well off, but he is so very, very lonely!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sunday following, the little boy took something, and wrapped it up\\r\\nin a piece of paper, went downstairs, and stood in the doorway; and when\\r\\nthe man who went on errands came past, he said to him--\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say, master! will you give this to the old man over the way from me?\\r\\nI have two pewter soldiers--this is one of them, and he shall have it,\\r\\nfor I know he is so very, very lonely.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the old errand man looked quite pleased, nodded, and took the pewter\\r\\nsoldier over to the old house. Afterwards there came a message; it was\\r\\nto ask if the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a\\r\\nvisit; and so he got permission of his parents, and then went over to\\r\\nthe old house.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than ever;\\r\\none would have thought they were polished on account of the visit; and\\r\\nit was as if the carved-out trumpeters--for there were trumpeters, who\\r\\nstood in tulips, carved out on the door--blew with all their\\r\\nmight, their cheeks appeared so much rounder than before. Yes, they\\r\\nblew--“Trateratra! The little boy comes! Trateratra!”--and then the door\\r\\nopened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor, and\\r\\nladies in silken gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silken gowns\\r\\nrustled! And then there was a flight of stairs which went a good way\\r\\nupwards, and a little way downwards, and then one came on a balcony\\r\\nwhich was in a very dilapidated state, sure enough, with large holes and\\r\\nlong crevices, but grass grew there and leaves out of them altogether,\\r\\nfor the whole balcony outside, the yard, and the walls, were overgrown\\r\\nwith so much green stuff, that it looked like a garden; only a balcony.\\r\\nHere stood old flower-pots with faces and asses' ears, and the flowers\\r\\ngrew just as they liked. One of the pots was quite overrun on all sides\\r\\nwith pinks, that is to say, with the green part; shoot stood by shoot,\\r\\nand it said quite distinctly, “The air has cherished me, the sun has\\r\\nkissed me, and promised me a little flower on Sunday! a little flower on\\r\\nSunday!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog's\\r\\nleather, and printed with gold flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n   “The gilding decays,\\r\\n   But hog's leather stays!”\\r\\n\\r\\nsaid the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved out,\\r\\nand with arms on both sides. “Sit down! sit down!” said they. “Ugh! how\\r\\nI creak; now I shall certainly get the gout, like the old clothespress,\\r\\nugh!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows\\r\\nwere, and where the old man sat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!” said the old\\r\\nman. “And I thank you because you come over to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thankee! thankee!” or “cranky! cranky!” sounded from all the furniture;\\r\\nthere was so much of it, that each article stood in the other's way, to\\r\\nget a look at the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady,\\r\\nso young, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with clothes\\r\\nthat stood quite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said\\r\\n“thankee, thankee!” nor “cranky, cranky!” but looked with her mild eyes\\r\\nat the little boy, who directly asked the old man, “Where did you get\\r\\nher?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yonder, at the broker's,” said the old man, “where there are so many\\r\\npictures hanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they are all of\\r\\nthem buried; but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she has been dead\\r\\nand gone these fifty years!”\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of withered\\r\\nflowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so very old!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands turned,\\r\\nand everything in the room became still older; but they did not observe\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They say at home,” said the little boy, “that you are so very, very\\r\\nlonely!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” said he. “The old thoughts, with what they may bring with them,\\r\\ncome and visit me, and now you also come! I am very well off!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf; there were\\r\\nwhole long processions and pageants, with the strangest characters,\\r\\nwhich one never sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave of clubs,\\r\\nand citizens with waving flags: the tailors had theirs, with a pair of\\r\\nshears held by two lions--and the shoemakers theirs, without boots,\\r\\nbut with an eagle that had two heads, for the shoemakers must have\\r\\neverything so that they can say, it is a pair! Yes, that was a picture\\r\\nbook!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples, and\\r\\nnuts--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot bear it any longer!” said the pewter soldier, who sat on the\\r\\ndrawers. “It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has been in\\r\\na family circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot bear\\r\\nit any longer! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still\\r\\nlonger! Here it is not at all as it is over the way at your home, where\\r\\nyour father and mother spoke so pleasantly, and where you and all your\\r\\nsweet children made such a delightful noise. Nay, how lonely the old man\\r\\nis--do you think that he gets kisses? Do you think he gets mild eyes,\\r\\nor a Christmas tree? He will get nothing but a grave! I can bear it no\\r\\nlonger!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must not let it grieve you so much,” said the little boy. “I find\\r\\nit so very delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what\\r\\nthey may bring with them, they come and visit here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know\\r\\nthem!” said the pewter soldier. “I cannot bear it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you must!” said the little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the most\\r\\ndelicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy thought no\\r\\nmore about the pewter soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days\\r\\npassed away, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old\\r\\nhouse, and then the little boy went over there again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carved trumpeters blew, “Trateratra! There is the little boy!\\r\\nTrateratra!” and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled,\\r\\nand the silk gowns rustled; the hog's leather spoke, and the old chairs\\r\\nhad the gout in their legs and rheumatism in their backs: Ugh! it was\\r\\nexactly like the first time, for over there one day and hour was just\\r\\nlike another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot bear it!” said the pewter soldier. “I have shed pewter tears!\\r\\nIt is too melancholy! Rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and\\r\\nlegs! It would at least be a change. I cannot bear it longer! Now, I\\r\\nknow what it is to have a visit from one's old thoughts, with what they\\r\\nmay bring with them! I have had a visit from mine, and you may be sure\\r\\nit is no pleasant thing in the end; I was at last about to jump down\\r\\nfrom the drawers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were\\r\\nhere; it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before\\r\\nthe table and sung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood\\r\\ndevoutly with folded hands; and father and mother were just as pious;\\r\\nand then the door was opened, and little sister Mary, who is not two\\r\\nyears old yet, and who always dances when she hears music or singing, of\\r\\nwhatever kind it may be, was put into the room--though she ought not to\\r\\nhave been there--and then she began to dance, but could not keep time,\\r\\nbecause the tones were so long; and then she stood, first on the one\\r\\nleg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg, and bent\\r\\nher head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very seriously all\\r\\ntogether, although it was difficult enough; but I laughed to myself, and\\r\\nthen I fell off the table, and got a bump, which I have still--for it\\r\\nwas not right of me to laugh. But the whole now passes before me again\\r\\nin thought, and everything that I have lived to see; and these are the\\r\\nold thoughts, with what they may bring with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little\\r\\nMary! And how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is\\r\\nhappy enough, that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are given away as a present!” said the little boy. “You must\\r\\nremain. Can you not understand that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be seen,\\r\\nboth “tin boxes” and “balsam boxes,” old cards, so large and so gilded,\\r\\nsuch as one never sees them now. And several drawers were opened, and\\r\\nthe piano was opened; it had landscapes on the inside of the lid, and it\\r\\nwas so hoarse when the old man played on it! and then he hummed a song.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, she could sing that!” said he, and nodded to the portrait, which\\r\\nhe had bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!” shouted the pewter\\r\\nsoldier as loud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right\\r\\ndown on the floor. What became of him? The old man sought, and the\\r\\nlittle boy sought; he was away, and he stayed away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall find him!” said the old man; but he never found him. The floor\\r\\nwas too open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice, and there\\r\\nhe lay as in an open tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed,\\r\\nand several weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy was\\r\\nobliged to sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old\\r\\nhouse, and there the snow had been blown into all the carved work and\\r\\ninscriptions; it lay quite up over the steps, just as if there was no\\r\\none at home--nor was there any one at home--the old man was dead!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was borne\\r\\ninto it in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to lie in\\r\\nhis grave. He was driven out there, but no one followed; all his friends\\r\\nwere dead, and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was\\r\\ndriven away.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the\\r\\nlittle boy saw from his window how they carried the old knights and the\\r\\nold ladies away, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and\\r\\nthe old clothes-presses. Something came here, and something came there;\\r\\nthe portrait of her who had been found at the broker's came to the\\r\\nbroker's again; and there it hung, for no one knew her more--no one\\r\\ncared about the old picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was\\r\\na ruin. One could see from the street right into the room with the\\r\\nhog's-leather hanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass\\r\\nand leaves about the balcony hung quite wild about the falling beams.\\r\\nAnd then it was put to rights.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was a relief,” said the neighboring houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white\\r\\nwalls; but before it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a\\r\\nlittle garden laid out, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the\\r\\nneighboring house. Before the garden there was a large iron railing\\r\\nwith an iron door, it looked quite splendid, and people stood still and\\r\\npeeped in, and the sparrows hung by scores in the vine, and chattered\\r\\naway at each other as well as they could, but it was not about the old\\r\\nhouse, for they could not remember it, so many years had passed--so many\\r\\nthat the little boy had grown up to a whole man, yes, a clever man, and\\r\\na pleasure to his parents; and he had just been married, and, together\\r\\nwith his little wife, had come to live in the house here, where the\\r\\ngarden was; and he stood by her there whilst she planted a field-flower\\r\\nthat she found so pretty; she planted it with her little hand, and\\r\\npressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh! what was that? She\\r\\nhad stuck herself. There sat something pointed, straight out of the soft\\r\\nmould.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was--yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at\\r\\nthe old man's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and\\r\\nthe rubbish, and had at last laid for many years in the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf,\\r\\nand then with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful smell,\\r\\nthat it was to the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a\\r\\ntrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me see him,” said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his\\r\\nhead. “Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a pewter\\r\\nsoldier which I had when I was a little boy!” And then he told his wife\\r\\nabout the old house, and the old man, and about the pewter soldier that\\r\\nhe sent over to him because he was so very, very lonely; and he told it\\r\\nas correctly as it had really been, so that the tears came into the eyes\\r\\nof his young wife, on account of the old house and the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!” said\\r\\nshe. “I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told me;\\r\\nbut you must show me the old man's grave!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I do not know it,” said he, “and no one knows it! All his friends\\r\\nwere dead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How very, very lonely he must have been!” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very, very lonely!” said the pewter soldier. “But it is delightful not\\r\\nto be forgotten!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Delightful!” shouted something close by; but no one, except the pewter\\r\\nsoldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings; it had\\r\\nlost all its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but it had an\\r\\nopinion, and it gave it:\\r\\n\\r\\n   “The gilding decays,\\r\\n   But hog's leather stays!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis the pewter soldier did not believe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HAPPY FAMILY\\r\\n\\r\\nReally, the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf; if one\\r\\nholds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it over\\r\\none's head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella, for\\r\\nit is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone, but where there\\r\\ngrows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and all this\\r\\ndelightfulness is snails' food. The great white snails which persons of\\r\\nquality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said, “Hem,\\r\\nhem! how delicious!” for they thought it tasted so delicate--lived on\\r\\ndock-leaves, and therefore burdock seeds were sown.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate snails, they\\r\\nwere quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct, they grew and\\r\\ngrew all over the walks and all the beds; they could not get the mastery\\r\\nover them--it was a whole forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an\\r\\napple and a plum-tree, or else one never would have thought that it was\\r\\na garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last venerable old\\r\\nsnails.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey themselves knew not how old they were, but they could remember\\r\\nvery well that there had been many more; that they were of a family\\r\\nfrom foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the whole forest was\\r\\nplanted. They had never been outside it, but they knew that there was\\r\\nstill something more in the world, which was called the manor-house, and\\r\\nthat there they were boiled, and then they became black, and were then\\r\\nplaced on a silver dish; but what happened further they knew not; or, in\\r\\nfact, what it was to be boiled, and to lie on a silver dish, they could\\r\\nnot possibly imagine; but it was said to be delightful, and particularly\\r\\ngenteel. Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the earth-worms, whom they\\r\\nasked about it could give them any information--none of them had been\\r\\nboiled or laid on a silver dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the\\r\\nworld, that they knew; the forest was planted for their sake, and the\\r\\nmanor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver\\r\\ndish.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow they lived a very lonely and happy life; and as they had no children\\r\\nthemselves, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought\\r\\nup as their own; but the little one would not grow, for he was of a\\r\\ncommon family; but the old ones, especially Dame Mother Snail, thought\\r\\nthey could observe how he increased in size, and she begged father,\\r\\nif he could not see it, that he would at least feel the little snail's\\r\\nshell; and then he felt it, and found the good dame was right.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day there was a heavy storm of rain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hear how it beats like a drum on the dock-leaves!” said Father Snail.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are also rain-drops!” said Mother Snail. “And now the rain pours\\r\\nright down the stalk! You will see that it will be wet here! I am very\\r\\nhappy to think that we have our good house, and the little one has\\r\\nhis also! There is more done for us than for all other creatures, sure\\r\\nenough; but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world?\\r\\nWe are provided with a house from our birth, and the burdock forest is\\r\\nplanted for our sakes! I should like to know how far it extends, and\\r\\nwhat there is outside!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is nothing at all,” said Father Snail. “No place can be better\\r\\nthan ours, and I have nothing to wish for!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said the dame. “I would willingly go to the manorhouse, be\\r\\nboiled, and laid on a silver dish; all our forefathers have been treated\\r\\nso; there is something extraordinary in it, you may be sure!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin!” said Father Snail. “Or\\r\\nthe burdocks have grown up over it, so that they cannot come out. There\\r\\nneed not, however, be any haste about that; but you are always in such a\\r\\ntremendous hurry, and the little one is beginning to be the same. Has he\\r\\nnot been creeping up that stalk these three days? It gives me a headache\\r\\nwhen I look up to him!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must not scold him,” said Mother Snail. “He creeps so carefully; he\\r\\nwill afford us much pleasure--and we have nothing but him to live for!\\r\\nBut have you not thought of it? Where shall we get a wife for him? Do\\r\\nyou not think that there are some of our species at a great distance in\\r\\nthe interior of the burdock forest?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Black snails, I dare say, there are enough of,” said the old one.\\r\\n“Black snails without a house--but they are so common, and so conceited.\\r\\nBut we might give the ants a commission to look out for us; they run\\r\\nto and fro as if they had something to do, and they certainly know of a\\r\\nwife for our little snail!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know one, sure enough--the most charming one!” said one of the ants.\\r\\n“But I am afraid we shall hardly succeed, for she is a queen!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is nothing!” said the old folks. “Has she a house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She has a palace!” said the ant. “The finest ant's palace, with seven\\r\\nhundred passages!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thank you!” said Mother Snail. “Our son shall not go into an\\r\\nant-hill; if you know nothing better than that, we shall give the\\r\\ncommission to the white gnats. They fly far and wide, in rain and\\r\\nsunshine; they know the whole forest here, both within and without.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have a wife for him,” said the gnats. “At a hundred human paces from\\r\\nhere there sits a little snail in her house, on a gooseberry bush; she\\r\\nis quite lonely, and old enough to be married. It is only a hundred\\r\\nhuman paces!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, let her come to him!” said the old ones. “He has a whole\\r\\nforest of burdocks, she has only a bush!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they went and fetched little Miss Snail. It was a whole week\\r\\nbefore she arrived; but therein was just the very best of it, for one\\r\\ncould thus see that she was of the same species.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as\\r\\nthey could. In other respects the whole went off very quietly, for the\\r\\nold folks could not bear noise and merriment; but old Dame Snail made\\r\\na brilliant speech. Father Snail could not speak, he was too much\\r\\naffected; and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance, the whole\\r\\nforest of burdocks, and said--what they had always said--that it was\\r\\nthe best in the world; and if they lived honestly and decently, and\\r\\nincreased and multiplied, they and their children would once in the\\r\\ncourse of time come to the manor-house, be boiled black, and laid on\\r\\nsilver dishes. After this speech was made, the old ones crept into their\\r\\nshells, and never more came out. They slept; the young couple governed\\r\\nin the forest, and had a numerous progeny, but they were never boiled,\\r\\nand never came on the silver dishes; so from this they concluded that\\r\\nthe manor-house had fallen to ruins, and that all the men in the world\\r\\nwere extinct; and as no one contradicted them, so, of course it was so.\\r\\nAnd the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake,\\r\\nand the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their\\r\\nsakes; and they were very happy, and the whole family was happy; for\\r\\nthey, indeed were so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STORY OF A MOTHER\\r\\n\\r\\nA mother sat there with her little child. She was so downcast, so\\r\\nafraid that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed\\r\\nthemselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a\\r\\ndeep respiration, as if it sighed; and the mother looked still more\\r\\nsorrowfully on the little creature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man\\r\\nwrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he needed\\r\\nit, as it was the cold winter season! Everything out-of-doors was\\r\\ncovered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a moment,\\r\\nthe mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove,\\r\\nthat it might be warm for him; the old man sat and rocked the cradle,\\r\\nand the mother sat down on a chair close by him, and looked at her\\r\\nlittle sick child that drew its breath so deep, and raised its little\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you not think that I shall save him?” said she. “Our Lord will not\\r\\ntake him from me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the old man--it was Death himself--he nodded so strangely, it could\\r\\njust as well signify yes as no. And the mother looked down in her lap,\\r\\nand the tears ran down over her cheeks; her head became so heavy--she\\r\\nhad not closed her eyes for three days and nights; and now she slept,\\r\\nbut only for a minute, when she started up and trembled with cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is that?” said she, and looked on all sides; but the old man was\\r\\ngone, and her little child was gone--he had taken it with him; and the\\r\\nold clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden weight ran\\r\\ndown to the floor, bump! and then the clock also stood still.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut there, in the midst of the snow, there sat a woman in long, black\\r\\nclothes; and she said, “Death has been in thy chamber, and I saw him\\r\\nhasten away with thy little child; he goes faster than the wind, and he\\r\\nnever brings back what he takes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, only tell me which way he went!” said the mother. “Tell me the way,\\r\\nand I shall find him!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know it!” said the woman in the black clothes. “But before I tell it,\\r\\nthou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child!\\r\\nI am fond of them. I have heard them before; I am Night; I saw thy tears\\r\\nwhilst thou sang'st them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will sing them all, all!” said the mother. “But do not stop me now--I\\r\\nmay overtake him--I may find my child!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Night stood still and mute. Then the mother wrung her hands, sang\\r\\nand wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears; and then\\r\\nNight said, “Go to the right, into the dark pine forest; thither I saw\\r\\nDeath take his way with thy little child!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest, and she no\\r\\nlonger knew whither she should go! then there stood a thorn-bush;\\r\\nthere was neither leaf nor flower on it, it was also in the cold winter\\r\\nseason, and ice-flakes hung on the branches.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hast thou not seen Death go past with my little child?” said the\\r\\nmother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said the thorn-bush; “but I will not tell thee which way he took,\\r\\nunless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart. I am freezing to death;\\r\\nI shall become a lump of ice!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast, so firmly, that it might\\r\\nbe thoroughly warmed, and the thorns went right into her flesh, and her\\r\\nblood flowed in large drops, but the thornbush shot forth fresh green\\r\\nleaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night, the heart\\r\\nof the afflicted mother was so warm; and the thorn-bush told her the way\\r\\nshe should go.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then came to a large lake, where there was neither ship nor boat.\\r\\nThe lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her; neither was it open,\\r\\nnor low enough that she could wade through it; and across it she must go\\r\\nif she would find her child! Then she lay down to drink up the lake, and\\r\\nthat was an impossibility for a human being, but the afflicted mother\\r\\nthought that a miracle might happen nevertheless.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, what would I not give to come to my child!” said the weeping\\r\\nmother; and she wept still more, and her eyes sunk down in the depths of\\r\\nthe waters, and became two precious pearls; but the water bore her up,\\r\\nas if she sat in a swing, and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore\\r\\non the opposite side, where there stood a mile-broad, strange house, one\\r\\nknew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns, or if it were\\r\\nbuilt up; but the poor mother could not see it; she had wept her eyes\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where shall I find Death, who took away my little child?” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has not come here yet!” said the old grave woman, who was appointed\\r\\nto look after Death's great greenhouse! “How have you been able to find\\r\\nthe way hither? And who has helped you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“OUR LORD has helped me,” said she. “He is merciful, and you will also\\r\\nbe so! Where shall I find my little child?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, I know not,” said the woman, “and you cannot see! Many flowers and\\r\\ntrees have withered this night; Death will soon come and plant them over\\r\\nagain! You certainly know that every person has his or her life's tree\\r\\nor flower, just as everyone happens to be settled; they look like other\\r\\nplants, but they have pulsations of the heart. Children's hearts can\\r\\nalso beat; go after yours, perhaps you may know your child's; but what\\r\\nwill you give me if I tell you what you shall do more?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have nothing to give,” said the afflicted mother, “but I will go to\\r\\nthe world's end for you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, I have nothing to do there!” said the woman. “But you can give\\r\\nme your long black hair; you know yourself that it is fine, and that\\r\\nI like! You shall have my white hair instead, and that's always\\r\\nsomething!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you demand nothing else?” said she. “That I will gladly give you!”\\r\\n And she gave her her fine black hair, and got the old woman's snow-white\\r\\nhair instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees\\r\\ngrew strangely into one another. There stood fine hyacinths under glass\\r\\nbells, and there stood strong-stemmed peonies; there grew water plants,\\r\\nsome so fresh, others half sick, the water-snakes lay down on them,\\r\\nand black crabs pinched their stalks. There stood beautiful palm-trees,\\r\\noaks, and plantains; there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree\\r\\nand every flower had its name; each of them was a human life, the human\\r\\nframe still lived--one in China, and another in Greenland--round about\\r\\nin the world. There were large trees in small pots, so that they stood\\r\\nso stunted in growth, and ready to burst the pots; in other places,\\r\\nthere was a little dull flower in rich mould, with moss round about it,\\r\\nand it was so petted and nursed. But the distressed mother bent down\\r\\nover all the smallest plants, and heard within them how the human heart\\r\\nbeat; and amongst millions she knew her child's.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There it is!” cried she, and stretched her hands out over a little blue\\r\\ncrocus, that hung quite sickly on one side.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don't touch the flower!” said the old woman. “But place yourself here,\\r\\nand when Death comes--I expect him every moment--do not let him pluck\\r\\nthe flower up, but threaten him that you will do the same with the\\r\\nothers. Then he will be afraid! He is responsible for them to OUR LORD,\\r\\nand no one dares to pluck them up before HE gives leave.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall, and the blind\\r\\nmother could feel that it was Death that came.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How hast thou been able to find thy way hither?” he asked. “How couldst\\r\\nthou come quicker than I?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am a mother,” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower,\\r\\nbut she held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that\\r\\nshe should touch one of the leaves. Then Death blew on her hands, and\\r\\nshe felt that it was colder than the cold wind, and her hands fell down\\r\\npowerless.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thou canst not do anything against me!” said Death.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But OUR LORD can!” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I only do His bidding!” said Death. “I am His gardener, I take all His\\r\\nflowers and trees, and plant them out in the great garden of Paradise,\\r\\nin the unknown land; but how they grow there, and how it is there I dare\\r\\nnot tell thee.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me back my child!” said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At\\r\\nonce she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand,\\r\\nand cried out to Death, “I will tear all thy flowers off, for I am in\\r\\ndespair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Touch them not!” said Death. “Thou say'st that thou art so unhappy, and\\r\\nnow thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Another mother!” said the poor woman, and directly let go her hold of\\r\\nboth the flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, thou hast thine eyes,” said Death; “I fished them up from the\\r\\nlake, they shone so bright; I knew not they were thine. Take them again,\\r\\nthey are now brighter than before; now look down into the deep well\\r\\nclose by; I shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst\\r\\nhave torn up, and thou wilt see their whole future life--their whole\\r\\nhuman existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she looked down into the well; and it was a happiness to see how the\\r\\none became a blessing to the world, to see how much happiness and joy\\r\\nwere felt everywhere. And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow\\r\\nand distress, horror, and wretchedness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Both of them are God's will!” said Death.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which of them is Misfortune's flower and which is that of Happiness?”\\r\\n asked she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I will not tell thee,” said Death; “but this thou shalt know from\\r\\nme, that the one flower was thy own child! it was thy child's fate thou\\r\\nsaw'st--thy own child's future life!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the mother screamed with terror, “Which of them was my child? Tell\\r\\nit me! Save the innocent! Save my child from all that misery! Rather\\r\\ntake it away! Take it into God's kingdom! Forget my tears, forget my\\r\\nprayers, and all that I have done!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not understand thee!” said Death. “Wilt thou have thy child again,\\r\\nor shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to our\\r\\nLord: “Oh, hear me not when I pray against Thy will, which is the best!\\r\\nhear me not! hear me not!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she bowed her head down in her lap, and Death took her child and\\r\\nwent with it into the unknown land.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FALSE COLLAR\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a fine gentleman, all of whose moveables were a boot-jack\\r\\nand a hair-comb: but he had the finest false collars in the world; and\\r\\nit is about one of these collars that we are now to hear a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was so old, that it began to think of marriage; and it happened that\\r\\nit came to be washed in company with a garter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay!” said the collar. “I never did see anything so slender and so\\r\\nfine, so soft and so neat. May I not ask your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I shall not tell you!” said the garter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where do you live?” asked the collar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the garter was so bashful, so modest, and thought it was a strange\\r\\nquestion to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are certainly a girdle,” said the collar; “that is to say an inside\\r\\ngirdle. I see well that you are both for use and ornament, my dear young\\r\\nlady.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will thank you not to speak to me,” said the garter. “I think I have\\r\\nnot given the least occasion for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes! When one is as handsome as you,” said the collar, “that is\\r\\noccasion enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don't come so near me, I beg of you!” said the garter. “You look so\\r\\nmuch like those men-folks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am also a fine gentleman,” said the collar. “I have a bootjack and a\\r\\nhair-comb.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that was not true, for it was his master who had them: but he\\r\\nboasted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don't come so near me,” said the garter: “I am not accustomed to it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Prude!” exclaimed the collar; and then it was taken out of the\\r\\nwashing-tub. It was starched, hung over the back of a chair in the\\r\\nsunshine, and was then laid on the ironing-blanket; then came the warm\\r\\nbox-iron. “Dear lady!” said the collar. “Dear widow-lady! I feel quite\\r\\nhot. I am quite changed. I begin to unfold myself. You will burn a hole\\r\\nin me. Oh! I offer you my hand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rag!” said the box-iron; and went proudly over the collar: for she\\r\\nfancied she was a steam-engine, that would go on the railroad and draw\\r\\nthe waggons. “Rag!” said the box-iron.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collar was a little jagged at the edge, and so came the long\\r\\nscissors to cut off the jagged part. “Oh!” said the collar. “You are\\r\\ncertainly the first opera dancer. How well you can stretch your legs\\r\\nout! It is the most graceful performance I have ever seen. No one can\\r\\nimitate you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know it,” said the scissors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You deserve to be a baroness,” said the collar. “All that I have is a\\r\\nfine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a hair-comb. If I only had the barony!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you seek my hand?” said the scissors; for she was angry; and without\\r\\nmore ado, she CUT HIM, and then he was condemned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall now be obliged to ask the hair-comb. It is surprising how well\\r\\nyou preserve your teeth, Miss,” said the collar. “Have you never thought\\r\\nof being betrothed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, of course! you may be sure of that,” said the hair-comb. “I AM\\r\\nbetrothed--to the boot-jack!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Betrothed!” exclaimed the collar. Now there was no other to court, and\\r\\nso he despised it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time passed away, then the collar came into the rag chest at the\\r\\npaper mill; there was a large company of rags, the fine by themselves,\\r\\nand the coarse by themselves, just as it should be. They all had much to\\r\\nsay, but the collar the most; for he was a real boaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have had such an immense number of sweethearts!” said the collar.\\r\\n“I could not be in peace! It is true, I was always a fine starched-up\\r\\ngentleman! I had both a boot-jack and a hair-comb, which I never used!\\r\\nYou should have seen me then, you should have seen me when I lay down!\\r\\nI shall never forget MY FIRST LOVE--she was a girdle, so fine, so soft,\\r\\nand so charming, she threw herself into a tub of water for my sake!\\r\\nThere was also a widow, who became glowing hot, but I left her standing\\r\\ntill she got black again; there was also the first opera dancer, she\\r\\ngave me that cut which I now go with, she was so ferocious! My\\r\\nown hair-comb was in love with me, she lost all her teeth from the\\r\\nheart-ache; yes, I have lived to see much of that sort of thing; but I\\r\\nam extremely sorry for the garter--I mean the girdle--that went into the\\r\\nwater-tub. I have much on my conscience, I want to become white paper!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it became so, all the rags were turned into white paper; but the\\r\\ncollar came to be just this very piece of white paper we here see,\\r\\nand on which the story is printed; and that was because it boasted so\\r\\nterribly afterwards of what had never happened to it. It would be well\\r\\nfor us to beware, that we may not act in a similar manner, for we can\\r\\nnever know if we may not, in the course of time, also come into the\\r\\nrag chest, and be made into white paper, and then have our whole life's\\r\\nhistory printed on it, even the most secret, and be obliged to run about\\r\\nand tell it ourselves, just like this collar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SHADOW\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in the hot lands that the sun burns, sure enough! there the people\\r\\nbecome quite a mahogany brown, ay, and in the HOTTEST lands they are\\r\\nburnt to Negroes. But now it was only to the HOT lands that a learned\\r\\nman had come from the cold; there he thought that he could run about\\r\\njust as when at home, but he soon found out his mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, and all sensible folks, were obliged to stay within doors--the\\r\\nwindow-shutters and doors were closed the whole day; it looked as if the\\r\\nwhole house slept, or there was no one at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrow street with the high houses, was built so that the sunshine\\r\\nmust fall there from morning till evening--it was really not to be\\r\\nborne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe learned man from the cold lands--he was a young man, and seemed to\\r\\nbe a clever man--sat in a glowing oven; it took effect on him, he became\\r\\nquite meagre--even his shadow shrunk in, for the sun had also an effect\\r\\non it. It was first towards evening when the sun was down, that they\\r\\nbegan to freshen up again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the warm lands every window has a balcony, and the people came out on\\r\\nall the balconies in the street--for one must have air, even if one be\\r\\naccustomed to be mahogany!* It was lively both up and down the\\r\\nstreet. Tailors, and shoemakers, and all the folks, moved out into the\\r\\nstreet--chairs and tables were brought forth--and candles burnt--yes,\\r\\nabove a thousand lights were burning--and the one talked and the other\\r\\nsung; and people walked and church-bells rang, and asses went along with\\r\\na dingle-dingle-dong! for they too had bells on. The street boys were\\r\\nscreaming and hooting, and shouting and shooting, with devils and\\r\\ndetonating balls--and there came corpse bearers and hood wearers--for\\r\\nthere were funerals with psalm and hymn--and then the din of carriages\\r\\ndriving and company arriving: yes, it was, in truth, lively enough down\\r\\nin the street. Only in that single house, which stood opposite that in\\r\\nwhich the learned foreigner lived, it was quite still; and yet some one\\r\\nlived there, for there stood flowers in the balcony--they grew so\\r\\nwell in the sun's heat! and that they could not do unless they were\\r\\nwatered--and some one must water them--there must be somebody there.\\r\\nThe door opposite was also opened late in the evening, but it was dark\\r\\nwithin, at least in the front room; further in there was heard the sound\\r\\nof music. The learned foreigner thought it quite marvellous, but now--it\\r\\nmight be that he only imagined it--for he found everything marvellous\\r\\nout there, in the warm lands, if there had only been no sun. The\\r\\nstranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the house\\r\\nopposite, one saw no person about, and as to the music, it appeared\\r\\nto him to be extremely tiresome. “It is as if some one sat there, and\\r\\npractised a piece that he could not master--always the same piece. 'I\\r\\nshall master it!' says he; but yet he cannot master it, however long he\\r\\nplays.”\\r\\n\\r\\n* The word mahogany can be understood, in Danish, as having two\\r\\nmeanings. In general, it means the reddish-brown wood itself; but in\\r\\njest, it signifies “excessively fine,” which arose from an anecdote of\\r\\nNyboder, in Copenhagen, (the seamen's quarter.) A sailor's wife, who was\\r\\nalways proud and fine, in her way, came to her neighbor, and complained\\r\\nthat she had got a splinter in her finger. “What of?” asked the\\r\\nneighbor's wife. “It is a mahogany splinter,” said the other. “Mahogany!\\r\\nIt cannot be less with you!” exclaimed the woman--and thence the\\r\\nproverb, “It is so mahogany!”--(that is, so excessively fine)--is\\r\\nderived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night the stranger awoke--he slept with the doors of the balcony\\r\\nopen--the curtain before it was raised by the wind, and he thought\\r\\nthat a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house; all the\\r\\nflowers shone like flames, in the most beautiful colors, and in the\\r\\nmidst of the flowers stood a slender, graceful maiden--it was as if she\\r\\nalso shone; the light really hurt his eyes. He now opened them quite\\r\\nwide--yes, he was quite awake; with one spring he was on the floor; he\\r\\ncrept gently behind the curtain, but the maiden was gone; the flowers\\r\\nshone no longer, but there they stood, fresh and blooming as ever;\\r\\nthe door was ajar, and, far within, the music sounded so soft and\\r\\ndelightful, one could really melt away in sweet thoughts from it. Yet\\r\\nit was like a piece of enchantment. And who lived there? Where was the\\r\\nactual entrance? The whole of the ground-floor was a row of shops, and\\r\\nthere people could not always be running through.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening the stranger sat out on the balcony. The light burnt in the\\r\\nroom behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should\\r\\nfall on his opposite neighbor's wall. Yes! there it sat, directly\\r\\nopposite, between the flowers on the balcony; and when the stranger\\r\\nmoved, the shadow also moved: for that it always does.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there,” said\\r\\nthe learned man. “See, how nicely it sits between the flowers. The door\\r\\nstands half-open: now the shadow should be cunning, and go into the\\r\\nroom, look about, and then come and tell me what it had seen. Come, now!\\r\\nBe useful, and do me a service,” said he, in jest. “Have the kindness to\\r\\nstep in. Now! Art thou going?” and then he nodded to the shadow, and the\\r\\nshadow nodded again. “Well then, go! But don't stay away.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger rose, and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony\\r\\nrose also; the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned round.\\r\\nYes! if anyone had paid particular attention to it, they would have\\r\\nseen, quite distinctly, that the shadow went in through the half-open\\r\\nbalcony-door of their opposite neighbor, just as the stranger went into\\r\\nhis own room, and let the long curtain fall down after him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, the learned man went out to drink coffee and read the\\r\\nnewspapers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is that?” said he, as he came out into the sunshine. “I have no\\r\\nshadow! So then, it has actually gone last night, and not come again. It\\r\\nis really tiresome!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone, but because\\r\\nhe knew there was a story about a man without a shadow.* It was known\\r\\nto everybody at home, in the cold lands; and if the learned man now came\\r\\nthere and told his story, they would say that he was imitating it, and\\r\\nthat he had no need to do. He would, therefore, not talk about it at\\r\\nall; and that was wisely thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Peter Schlemihl, the shadowless man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening he went out again on the balcony. He had placed the light\\r\\ndirectly behind him, for he knew that the shadow would always have its\\r\\nmaster for a screen, but he could not entice it. He made himself little;\\r\\nhe made himself great: but no shadow came again. He said, “Hem! hem!”\\r\\n but it was of no use.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was vexatious; but in the warm lands everything grows so quickly; and\\r\\nafter the lapse of eight days he observed, to his great joy, that a new\\r\\nshadow came in the sunshine. In the course of three weeks he had a very\\r\\nfair shadow, which, when he set out for his home in the northern lands,\\r\\ngrew more and more in the journey, so that at last it was so long and so\\r\\nlarge, that it was more than sufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe learned man then came home, and he wrote books about what was true\\r\\nin the world, and about what was good and what was beautiful; and there\\r\\npassed days and years--yes! many years passed away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, as he was sitting in his room, there was a gentle knocking\\r\\nat the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come in!” said he; but no one came in; so he opened the door, and there\\r\\nstood before him such an extremely lean man, that he felt quite strange.\\r\\nAs to the rest, the man was very finely dressed--he must be a gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whom have I the honor of speaking?” asked the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes! I thought as much,” said the fine man. “I thought you would not\\r\\nknow me. I have got so much body. I have even got flesh and clothes. You\\r\\ncertainly never thought of seeing me so well off. Do you not know your\\r\\nold shadow? You certainly thought I should never more return. Things\\r\\nhave gone on well with me since I was last with you. I have, in all\\r\\nrespects, become very well off. Shall I purchase my freedom from\\r\\nservice? If so, I can do it”; and then he rattled a whole bunch of\\r\\nvaluable seals that hung to his watch, and he stuck his hand in the\\r\\nthick gold chain he wore around his neck--nay! how all his fingers\\r\\nglittered with diamond rings; and then all were pure gems.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay; I cannot recover from my surprise!” said the learned man. “What is\\r\\nthe meaning of all this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Something common, is it not,” said the shadow. “But you yourself do not\\r\\nbelong to the common order; and I, as you know well, have from a child\\r\\nfollowed in your footsteps. As soon as you found I was capable to go\\r\\nout alone in the world, I went my own way. I am in the most brilliant\\r\\ncircumstances, but there came a sort of desire over me to see you once\\r\\nmore before you die; you will die, I suppose? I also wished to see this\\r\\nland again--for you know we always love our native land. I know you have\\r\\ngot another shadow again; have I anything to pay to it or you? If so,\\r\\nyou will oblige me by saying what it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, is it really thou?” said the learned man. “It is most remarkable:\\r\\nI never imagined that one's old shadow could come again as a man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me what I have to pay,” said the shadow; “for I don't like to be\\r\\nin any sort of debt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How canst thou talk so?” said the learned man. “What debt is there to\\r\\ntalk about? Make thyself as free as anyone else. I am extremely glad to\\r\\nhear of thy good fortune: sit down, old friend, and tell me a little\\r\\nhow it has gone with thee, and what thou hast seen at our opposite\\r\\nneighbor's there--in the warm lands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I will tell you all about it,” said the shadow, and sat down: “but\\r\\nthen you must also promise me, that, wherever you may meet me, you will\\r\\nnever say to anyone here in the town that I have been your shadow. I\\r\\nintend to get betrothed, for I can provide for more than one family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be quite at thy ease about that,” said the learned man; “I shall not\\r\\nsay to anyone who thou actually art: here is my hand--I promise it, and\\r\\na man's bond is his word.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A word is a shadow,” said the shadow, “and as such it must speak.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was really quite astonishing how much of a man it was. It was dressed\\r\\nentirely in black, and of the very finest cloth; it had patent leather\\r\\nboots, and a hat that could be folded together, so that it was bare\\r\\ncrown and brim; not to speak of what we already know it had--seals, gold\\r\\nneck-chain, and diamond rings; yes, the shadow was well-dressed, and it\\r\\nwas just that which made it quite a man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now I shall tell you my adventures,” said the shadow; and then he\\r\\nsat, with the polished boots, as heavily as he could, on the arm of the\\r\\nlearned man's new shadow, which lay like a poodle-dog at his feet.\\r\\nNow this was perhaps from arrogance; and the shadow on the ground kept\\r\\nitself so still and quiet, that it might hear all that passed: it wished\\r\\nto know how it could get free, and work its way up, so as to become its\\r\\nown master.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know who lived in our opposite neighbor's house?” said the\\r\\nshadow. “It was the most charming of all beings, it was Poesy! I was\\r\\nthere for three weeks, and that has as much effect as if one had lived\\r\\nthree thousand years, and read all that was composed and written;\\r\\nthat is what I say, and it is right. I have seen everything and I know\\r\\neverything!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poesy!” cried the learned man. “Yes, yes, she often dwells a recluse\\r\\nin large cities! Poesy! Yes, I have seen her--a single short moment,\\r\\nbut sleep came into my eyes! She stood on the balcony and shone as the\\r\\nAurora Borealis shines. Go on, go on--thou wert on the balcony, and went\\r\\nthrough the doorway, and then--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I was in the antechamber,” said the shadow. “You always sat and\\r\\nlooked over to the antechamber. There was no light; there was a sort\\r\\nof twilight, but the one door stood open directly opposite the other\\r\\nthrough a long row of rooms and saloons, and there it was lighted up. I\\r\\nshould have been completely killed if I had gone over to the maiden; but\\r\\nI was circumspect, I took time to think, and that one must always do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what didst thou then see?” asked the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw everything, and I shall tell all to you: but--it is no pride on\\r\\nmy part--as a free man, and with the knowledge I have, not to speak of\\r\\nmy position in life, my excellent circumstances--I certainly wish that\\r\\nyou would say YOU* to me!”\\r\\n\\r\\n* It is the custom in Denmark for intimate acquaintances to use the\\r\\nsecond person singular, “Du,” (thou) when speaking to each other. When\\r\\na friendship is formed between men, they generally affirm it, when\\r\\noccasion offers, either in public or private, by drinking to each other\\r\\nand exclaiming, “thy health,” at the same time striking their glasses\\r\\ntogether. This is called drinking “Duus”: they are then, “Duus Brodre,”\\r\\n (thou brothers) and ever afterwards use the pronoun “thou,” to each\\r\\nother, it being regarded as more familiar than “De,” (you). Father and\\r\\nmother, sister and brother say thou to one another--without regard to\\r\\nage or rank. Master and mistress say thou to their servants the superior\\r\\nto the inferior. But servants and inferiors do not use the same term\\r\\nto their masters, or superiors--nor is it ever used when speaking to a\\r\\nstranger, or anyone with whom they are but slightly acquainted--they\\r\\nthen say as in English--you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg your pardon,” said the learned man; “it is an old habit with me.\\r\\nYOU are perfectly right, and I shall remember it; but now you must tell\\r\\nme all YOU saw!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everything!” said the shadow. “For I saw everything, and I know\\r\\neverything!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did it look in the furthest saloon?” asked the learned man. “Was it\\r\\nthere as in the fresh woods? Was it there as in a holy church? Were the\\r\\nsaloons like the starlit firmament when we stand on the high mountains?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everything was there!” said the shadow. “I did not go quite in, I\\r\\nremained in the foremost room, in the twilight, but I stood there\\r\\nquite well; I saw everything, and I know everything! I have been in the\\r\\nantechamber at the court of Poesy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But WHAT DID you see? Did all the gods of the olden times pass through\\r\\nthe large saloons? Did the old heroes combat there? Did sweet children\\r\\nplay there, and relate their dreams?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you I was there, and you can conceive that I saw everything\\r\\nthere was to be seen. Had you come over there, you would not have been\\r\\na man; but I became so! And besides, I learned to know my inward nature,\\r\\nmy innate qualities, the relationship I had with Poesy. At the time I\\r\\nwas with you, I thought not of that, but always--you know it well--when\\r\\nthe sun rose, and when the sun went down, I became so strangely great;\\r\\nin the moonlight I was very near being more distinct than yourself; at\\r\\nthat time I did not understand my nature; it was revealed to me in the\\r\\nantechamber! I became a man! I came out matured; but you were no longer\\r\\nin the warm lands; as a man I was ashamed to go as I did. I was in\\r\\nwant of boots, of clothes, of the whole human varnish that makes a man\\r\\nperceptible. I took my way--I tell it to you, but you will not put it in\\r\\nany book--I took my way to the cake woman--I hid myself behind her;\\r\\nthe woman didn't think how much she concealed. I went out first in the\\r\\nevening; I ran about the streets in the moonlight; I made myself long up\\r\\nthe walls--it tickles the back so delightfully! I ran up, and ran down,\\r\\npeeped into the highest windows, into the saloons, and on the roofs, I\\r\\npeeped in where no one could peep, and I saw what no one else saw, what\\r\\nno one else should see! This is, in fact, a base world! I would not be a\\r\\nman if it were not now once accepted and regarded as something to be so!\\r\\nI saw the most unimaginable things with the women, with the men, with\\r\\nparents, and with the sweet, matchless children; I saw,” said the\\r\\nshadow, “what no human being must know, but what they would all\\r\\nso willingly know--what is bad in their neighbor. Had I written a\\r\\nnewspaper, it would have been read! But I wrote direct to the persons\\r\\nthemselves, and there was consternation in all the towns where I came.\\r\\nThey were so afraid of me, and yet they were so excessively fond of\\r\\nme. The professors made a professor of me; the tailors gave me new\\r\\nclothes--I am well furnished; the master of the mint struck new coin for\\r\\nme, and the women said I was so handsome! And so I became the man I am.\\r\\nAnd I now bid you farewell. Here is my card--I live on the sunny side\\r\\nof the street, and am always at home in rainy weather!” And so away went\\r\\nthe shadow. “That was most extraordinary!” said the learned man. Years\\r\\nand days passed away, then the shadow came again. “How goes it?” said\\r\\nthe shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alas!” said the learned man. “I write about the true, and the good,\\r\\nand the beautiful, but no one cares to hear such things; I am quite\\r\\ndesperate, for I take it so much to heart!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I don't!” said the shadow. “I become fat, and it is that one wants\\r\\nto become! You do not understand the world. You will become ill by it.\\r\\nYou must travel! I shall make a tour this summer; will you go with me?\\r\\nI should like to have a travelling companion! Will you go with me, as\\r\\nshadow? It will be a great pleasure for me to have you with me; I shall\\r\\npay the travelling expenses!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, this is too much!” said the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is just as one takes it!” said the shadow. “It will do you much good\\r\\nto travel! Will you be my shadow? You shall have everything free on the\\r\\njourney!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, that is too bad!” said the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it is just so with the world!” said the shadow, “and so it will\\r\\nbe!” and away it went again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe learned man was not at all in the most enviable state; grief and\\r\\ntorment followed him, and what he said about the true, and the good, and\\r\\nthe beautiful, was, to most persons, like roses for a cow! He was quite\\r\\nill at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You really look like a shadow!” said his friends to him; and the\\r\\nlearned man trembled, for he thought of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must go to a watering-place!” said the shadow, who came and visited\\r\\nhim. “There is nothing else for it! I will take you with me for old\\r\\nacquaintance' sake; I will pay the travelling expenses, and you write\\r\\nthe descriptions--and if they are a little amusing for me on the way!\\r\\nI will go to a watering-place--my beard does not grow out as it\\r\\nought--that is also a sickness--and one must have a beard! Now you be\\r\\nwise and accept the offer; we shall travel as comrades!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so they travelled; the shadow was master, and the master was the\\r\\nshadow; they drove with each other, they rode and walked together, side\\r\\nby side, before and behind, just as the sun was; the shadow always took\\r\\ncare to keep itself in the master's place. Now the learned man didn't\\r\\nthink much about that; he was a very kind-hearted man, and particularly\\r\\nmild and friendly, and so he said one day to the shadow: “As we have\\r\\nnow become companions, and in this way have grown up together from\\r\\nchildhood, shall we not drink 'thou' together, it is more familiar?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are right,” said the shadow, who was now the proper master. “It is\\r\\nsaid in a very straight-forward and well-meant manner. You, as a learned\\r\\nman, certainly know how strange nature is. Some persons cannot bear to\\r\\ntouch grey paper, or they become ill; others shiver in every limb if one\\r\\nrub a pane of glass with a nail: I have just such a feeling on hearing\\r\\nyou say thou to me; I feel myself as if pressed to the earth in my first\\r\\nsituation with you. You see that it is a feeling; that it is not pride:\\r\\nI cannot allow you to say THOU to me, but I will willingly say THOU to\\r\\nyou, so it is half done!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the shadow said THOU to its former master.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is rather too bad,” thought he, “that I must say YOU and he say\\r\\nTHOU,” but he was now obliged to put up with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they came to a watering-place where there were many strangers, and\\r\\namongst them was a princess, who was troubled with seeing too well; and\\r\\nthat was so alarming!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe directly observed that the stranger who had just come was quite a\\r\\ndifferent sort of person to all the others; “He has come here in order\\r\\nto get his beard to grow, they say, but I see the real cause, he cannot\\r\\ncast a shadow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had become inquisitive; and so she entered into conversation\\r\\ndirectly with the strange gentleman, on their promenades. As the\\r\\ndaughter of a king, she needed not to stand upon trifles, so she said,\\r\\n“Your complaint is, that you cannot cast a shadow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your Royal Highness must be improving considerably,” said the shadow,\\r\\n“I know your complaint is, that you see too clearly, but it has\\r\\ndecreased, you are cured. I just happen to have a very unusual shadow!\\r\\nDo you not see that person who always goes with me? Other persons have\\r\\na common shadow, but I do not like what is common to all. We give our\\r\\nservants finer cloth for their livery than we ourselves use, and so I\\r\\nhad my shadow trimmed up into a man: yes, you see I have even given him\\r\\na shadow. It is somewhat expensive, but I like to have something for\\r\\nmyself!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What!” thought the princess. “Should I really be cured! These baths are\\r\\nthe first in the world! In our time water has wonderful powers. But I\\r\\nshall not leave the place, for it now begins to be amusing here. I am\\r\\nextremely fond of that stranger: would that his beard should not grow,\\r\\nfor in that case he will leave us!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, the princess and the shadow danced together in the large\\r\\nball-room. She was light, but he was still lighter; she had never had\\r\\nsuch a partner in the dance. She told him from what land she came, and\\r\\nhe knew that land; he had been there, but then she was not at home; he\\r\\nhad peeped in at the window, above and below--he had seen both the\\r\\none and the other, and so he could answer the princess, and make\\r\\ninsinuations, so that she was quite astonished; he must be the wisest\\r\\nman in the whole world! She felt such respect for what he knew! So that\\r\\nwhen they again danced together she fell in love with him; and that the\\r\\nshadow could remark, for she almost pierced him through with her eyes.\\r\\nSo they danced once more together; and she was about to declare herself,\\r\\nbut she was discreet; she thought of her country and kingdom, and of the\\r\\nmany persons she would have to reign over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is a wise man,” said she to herself--“It is well; and he dances\\r\\ndelightfully--that is also good; but has he solid knowledge? That is\\r\\njust as important! He must be examined.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she began, by degrees, to question him about the most difficult\\r\\nthings she could think of, and which she herself could not have\\r\\nanswered; so that the shadow made a strange face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You cannot answer these questions?” said the princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They belong to my childhood's learning,” said the shadow. “I really\\r\\nbelieve my shadow, by the door there, can answer them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your shadow!” said the princess. “That would indeed be marvellous!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not say for a certainty that he can,” said the shadow, “but I\\r\\nthink so; he has now followed me for so many years, and listened to my\\r\\nconversation--I should think it possible. But your royal highness will\\r\\npermit me to observe, that he is so proud of passing himself off for\\r\\na man, that when he is to be in a proper humor--and he must be so to\\r\\nanswer well--he must be treated quite like a man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! I like that!” said the princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she went to the learned man by the door, and she spoke to him about\\r\\nthe sun and the moon, and about persons out of and in the world, and he\\r\\nanswered with wisdom and prudence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a man that must be who has so wise a shadow!” thought she. “It\\r\\nwill be a real blessing to my people and kingdom if I choose him for my\\r\\nconsort--I will do it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were soon agreed, both the princess and the shadow; but no one was\\r\\nto know about it before she arrived in her own kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one--not even my shadow!” said the shadow, and he had his own\\r\\nthoughts about it!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow they were in the country where the princess reigned when she was at\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen, my good friend,” said the shadow to the learned man. “I have\\r\\nnow become as happy and mighty as anyone can be; I will, therefore, do\\r\\nsomething particular for thee! Thou shalt always live with me in the\\r\\npalace, drive with me in my royal carriage, and have ten thousand\\r\\npounds a year; but then thou must submit to be called SHADOW by all and\\r\\neveryone; thou must not say that thou hast ever been a man; and once\\r\\na year, when I sit on the balcony in the sunshine, thou must lie at my\\r\\nfeet, as a shadow shall do! I must tell thee: I am going to marry the\\r\\nking's daughter, and the nuptials are to take place this evening!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, this is going too far!” said the learned man. “I will not have it;\\r\\nI will not do it! It is to deceive the whole country and the princess\\r\\ntoo! I will tell everything! That I am a man, and that thou art a\\r\\nshadow--thou art only dressed up!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no one who will believe it!” said the shadow. “Be reasonable,\\r\\nor I will call the guard!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will go directly to the princess!” said the learned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I will go first!” said the shadow. “And thou wilt go to prison!”\\r\\n and that he was obliged to do--for the sentinels obeyed him whom they\\r\\nknew the king's daughter was to marry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You tremble!” said the princess, as the shadow came into her chamber.\\r\\n“Has anything happened? You must not be unwell this evening, now that we\\r\\nare to have our nuptials celebrated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have lived to see the most cruel thing that anyone can live to\\r\\nsee!” said the shadow. “Only imagine--yes, it is true, such a poor\\r\\nshadow-skull cannot bear much--only think, my shadow has become mad;\\r\\nhe thinks that he is a man, and that I--now only think--that I am his\\r\\nshadow!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is terrible!” said the princess; “but he is confined, is he not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That he is. I am afraid that he will never recover.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor shadow!” said the princess. “He is very unfortunate; it would be\\r\\na real work of charity to deliver him from the little life he has, and,\\r\\nwhen I think properly over the matter, I am of opinion that it will be\\r\\nnecessary to do away with him in all stillness!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is certainly hard,” said the shadow, “for he was a faithful\\r\\nservant!” and then he gave a sort of sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a noble character!” said the princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole city was illuminated in the evening, and the cannons went off\\r\\nwith a bum! bum! and the soldiers presented arms. That was a marriage!\\r\\nThe princess and the shadow went out on the balcony to show themselves,\\r\\nand get another hurrah!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe learned man heard nothing of all this--for they had deprived him of\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE MATCH GIRL\\r\\n\\r\\nMost terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and\\r\\nevening--the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there\\r\\nwent along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked\\r\\nfeet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was\\r\\nthe good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had\\r\\nhitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them\\r\\nas she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that\\r\\nrolled by dreadfully fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by\\r\\nan urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for\\r\\na cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the\\r\\nlittle maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red\\r\\nand blue from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron,\\r\\nand she held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of\\r\\nher the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of\\r\\nsorrow, the poor little thing!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful\\r\\ncurls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now\\r\\nthought. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so\\r\\ndeliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of\\r\\nthat she thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the\\r\\nother, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet\\r\\nshe had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go\\r\\nhome she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could\\r\\nnot bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get\\r\\nblows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof,\\r\\nthrough which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were\\r\\nstopped up with straw and rags.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford\\r\\nher a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the\\r\\nbundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew\\r\\none out. “Rischt!” how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright\\r\\nflame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful\\r\\nlight. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting\\r\\nbefore a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass\\r\\nornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed\\r\\nso delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to\\r\\nwarm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she\\r\\nhad only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the\\r\\nlight fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a\\r\\nveil, so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a\\r\\nsnow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the\\r\\nroast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried\\r\\nplums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped\\r\\ndown from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its\\r\\nbreast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went\\r\\nout and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind.\\r\\nShe lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the most\\r\\nmagnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than\\r\\nthe one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and\\r\\ngaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked\\r\\ndown upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them\\r\\nwhen--the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher\\r\\nand higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and\\r\\nformed a long trail of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Someone is just dead!” said the little girl; for her old grandmother,\\r\\nthe only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told\\r\\nher, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the\\r\\nlustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild,\\r\\nand with such an expression of love.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Grandmother!” cried the little one. “Oh, take me with you! You go\\r\\naway when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the\\r\\ndelicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!” And\\r\\nshe rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for\\r\\nshe wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And\\r\\nthe matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at\\r\\nnoon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and\\r\\nso tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in\\r\\nbrightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was neither\\r\\ncold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with\\r\\nrosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen\\r\\nto death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the\\r\\nchild there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. “She\\r\\nwanted to warm herself,” people said. No one had the slightest suspicion\\r\\nof what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the\\r\\nsplendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a\\r\\nnew year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DREAM OF LITTLE TUK\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! yes, that was little Tuk: in reality his name was not Tuk, but that\\r\\nwas what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for\\r\\nCharles, and it is all well enough if one does but know it. He had now\\r\\nto take care of his little sister Augusta, who was much younger than\\r\\nhimself, and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same time; but\\r\\nthese two things would not do together at all. There sat the poor little\\r\\nfellow, with his sister on his lap, and he sang to her all the songs he\\r\\nknew; and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book\\r\\nthat lay open before him. By the next morning he was to have learnt\\r\\nall the towns in Zealand by heart, and to know about them all that is\\r\\npossible to be known.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mother now came home, for she had been out, and took little Augusta\\r\\non her arm. Tuk ran quickly to the window, and read so eagerly that he\\r\\npretty nearly read his eyes out; for it got darker and darker, but his\\r\\nmother had no money to buy a candle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There goes the old washerwoman over the way,” said his mother, as she\\r\\nlooked out of the window. “The poor woman can hardly drag herself along,\\r\\nand she must now drag the pail home from the fountain. Be a good boy,\\r\\nTukey, and run across and help the old woman, won't you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Tuk ran over quickly and helped her; but when he came back again into\\r\\nthe room it was quite dark, and as to a light, there was no thought of\\r\\nsuch a thing. He was now to go to bed; that was an old turn-up bedstead;\\r\\nin it he lay and thought about his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and\\r\\nof all that his master had told him. He ought, to be sure, to have read\\r\\nover his lesson again, but that, you know, he could not do. He therefore\\r\\nput his geography-book under his pillow, because he had heard that was\\r\\na very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson; but one\\r\\ncannot, however, rely upon it entirely. Well, there he lay, and thought\\r\\nand thought, and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes\\r\\nand mouth: he slept, and yet he did not sleep; it was as though the old\\r\\nwasherwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said, “It were a great\\r\\nsin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning. You have aided\\r\\nme, I therefore will now help you; and the loving God will do so at all\\r\\ntimes.” And all of a sudden the book under Tuk's pillow began scraping\\r\\nand scratching.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kickery-ki! kluk! kluk! kluk!”--that was an old hen who came creeping\\r\\nalong, and she was from Kjoge. “I am a Kjoger hen,” [*] said she, and then\\r\\nshe related how many inhabitants there were there, and about the battle\\r\\nthat had taken place, and which, after all, was hardly worth talking\\r\\nabout.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * Kjoge, a town in the bay of Kjoge. “To see the Kjoge\\r\\n     hens,” is an expression similar to “showing a child London,”\\r\\n      which is said to be done by taking his head in both bands,\\r\\n     and so lifting him off the ground. At the invasion of the\\r\\n     English in 1807, an encounter of a no very glorious nature\\r\\n     took place between the British troops and the undisciplined\\r\\n     Danish militia.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kribledy, krabledy--plump!” down fell somebody: it was a wooden bird,\\r\\nthe popinjay used at the shooting-matches at Prastoe. Now he said that\\r\\nthere were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body; and he\\r\\nwas very proud. “Thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me.* Plump! Here\\r\\nI lie capitally.”\\r\\n\\r\\n* Prastoe, a still smaller town than Kjoge. Some hundred paces from\\r\\nit lies the manor-house Ny Soe, where Thorwaldsen, the famed sculptor,\\r\\ngenerally sojourned during his stay in Denmark, and where he called many\\r\\nof his immortal works into existence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut little Tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on\\r\\nhorseback. On he went at full gallop, still galloping on and on. A\\r\\nknight with a gleaming plume, and most magnificently dressed, held him\\r\\nbefore him on the horse, and thus they rode through the wood to the old\\r\\ntown of Bordingborg, and that was a large and very lively town. High\\r\\ntowers rose from the castle of the king, and the brightness of many\\r\\ncandles streamed from all the windows; within was dance and song,\\r\\nand King Waldemar and the young, richly-attired maids of honor danced\\r\\ntogether. The morn now came; and as soon as the sun appeared, the whole\\r\\ntown and the king's palace crumbled together, and one tower after the\\r\\nother; and at last only a single one remained standing where the castle\\r\\nhad been before,* and the town was so small and poor, and the school\\r\\nboys came along with their books under their arms, and said, “2000\\r\\ninhabitants!” but that was not true, for there were not so many.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Bordingborg, in the reign of King Waldemar, a considerable place, now\\r\\nan unimportant little town. One solitary tower only, and some remains of\\r\\na wall, show where the castle once stood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd little Tukey lay in his bed: it seemed to him as if he dreamed, and\\r\\nyet as if he were not dreaming; however, somebody was close beside him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Little Tukey! Little Tukey!” cried someone near. It was a seaman,\\r\\nquite a little personage, so little as if he were a midshipman; but a\\r\\nmidshipman it was not.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Many remembrances from Corsor.* That is a town that is just rising\\r\\ninto importance; a lively town that has steam-boats and stagecoaches:\\r\\nformerly people called it ugly, but that is no longer true. I lie on\\r\\nthe sea,” said Corsor; “I have high roads and gardens, and I have given\\r\\nbirth to a poet who was witty and amusing, which all poets are not. I\\r\\nonce intended to equip a ship that was to sail all round the earth; but\\r\\nI did not do it, although I could have done so: and then, too, I smell\\r\\nso deliciously, for close before the gate bloom the most beautiful\\r\\nroses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n*Corsor, on the Great Belt, called, formerly, before the introduction\\r\\nof steam-vessels, when travellers were often obliged to wait a long time\\r\\nfor a favorable wind, “the most tiresome of towns.” The poet Baggesen\\r\\nwas born here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Tuk looked, and all was red and green before his eyes; but as\\r\\nsoon as the confusion of colors was somewhat over, all of a sudden there\\r\\nappeared a wooded slope close to the bay, and high up above stood a\\r\\nmagnificent old church, with two high pointed towers. From out the\\r\\nhill-side spouted fountains in thick streams of water, so that there\\r\\nwas a continual splashing; and close beside them sat an old king with\\r\\na golden crown upon his white head: that was King Hroar, near the\\r\\nfountains, close to the town of Roeskilde, as it is now called. And up\\r\\nthe slope into the old church went all the kings and queens of Denmark,\\r\\nhand in hand, all with their golden crowns; and the organ played and\\r\\nthe fountains rustled. Little Tuk saw all, heard all. “Do not forget the\\r\\ndiet,” said King Hroar.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Roeskilde, once the capital of Denmark. The town takes its name from\\r\\nKing Hroar, and the many fountains in the neighborhood. In the beautiful\\r\\ncathedral the greater number of the kings and queens of Denmark are\\r\\ninterred. In Roeskilde, too, the members of the Danish Diet assemble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain all suddenly disappeared. Yes, and whither? It seemed to him\\r\\njust as if one turned over a leaf in a book. And now stood there an\\r\\nold peasant-woman, who came from Soroe,* where grass grows in the\\r\\nmarket-place. She had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and\\r\\nback: it was so wet, it certainly must have been raining. “Yes, that it\\r\\nhas,” said she; and she now related many pretty things out of Holberg's\\r\\ncomedies, and about Waldemar and Absalon; but all at once she cowered\\r\\ntogether, and her head began shaking backwards and forwards, and she\\r\\nlooked as she were going to make a spring. “Croak! croak!” said she.\\r\\n“It is wet, it is wet; there is such a pleasant deathlike stillness in\\r\\nSorbe!” She was now suddenly a frog, “Croak”; and now she was an old\\r\\nwoman. “One must dress according to the weather,” said she. “It is wet;\\r\\nit is wet. My town is just like a bottle; and one gets in by the neck,\\r\\nand by the neck one must get out again! In former times I had the\\r\\nfinest fish, and now I have fresh rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the\\r\\nbottle, who learn wisdom, Hebrew, Greek--Croak!”\\r\\n\\r\\n* Sorbe, a very quiet little town, beautifully situated, surrounded by\\r\\nwoods and lakes. Holberg, Denmark's Moliere, founded here an academy\\r\\nfor the sons of the nobles. The poets Hauch and Ingemann were appointed\\r\\nprofessors here. The latter lives there still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she spoke it sounded just like the noise of frogs, or as if one\\r\\nwalked with great boots over a moor; always the same tone, so uniform\\r\\nand so tiring that little Tuk fell into a good sound sleep, which, by\\r\\nthe bye, could not do him any harm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even in this sleep there came a dream, or whatever else it was: his\\r\\nlittle sister Augusta, she with the blue eyes and the fair curling hair,\\r\\nwas suddenly a tall, beautiful girl, and without having wings was yet\\r\\nable to fly; and she now flew over Zealand--over the green woods and the\\r\\nblue lakes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you hear the cock crow, Tukey? Cock-a-doodle-doo! The cocks are\\r\\nflying up from Kjoge! You will have a farm-yard, so large, oh! so very\\r\\nlarge! You will suffer neither hunger nor thirst! You will get on in the\\r\\nworld! You will be a rich and happy man! Your house will exalt itself\\r\\nlike King Waldemar's tower, and will be richly decorated with marble\\r\\nstatues, like that at Prastoe. You understand what I mean. Your name\\r\\nshall circulate with renown all round the earth, like unto the ship that\\r\\nwas to have sailed from Corsor; and in Roeskilde--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not forget the diet!” said King Hroar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you will speak well and wisely, little Tukey; and when at last you\\r\\nsink into your grave, you shall sleep as quietly--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As if I lay in Soroe,” said Tuk, awaking. It was bright day, and he was\\r\\nnow quite unable to call to mind his dream; that, however, was not at\\r\\nall necessary, for one may not know what the future will bring.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd out of bed he jumped, and read in his book, and now all at once he\\r\\nknew his whole lesson. And the old washerwoman popped her head in at the\\r\\ndoor, nodded to him friendly, and said, “Thanks, many thanks, my good\\r\\nchild, for your help! May the good ever-loving God fulfil your loveliest\\r\\ndream!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Tukey did not at all know what he had dreamed, but the loving God\\r\\nknew it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NAUGHTY BOY\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old poet. As\\r\\nhe was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm arose without,\\r\\nand the rain streamed down from heaven; but the old poet sat warm\\r\\nand comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire blazed and the\\r\\nroasting apple hissed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the skin,”\\r\\n said the good old poet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh let me in! Let me in! I am cold, and I'm so wet!” exclaimed suddenly\\r\\na child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance, while\\r\\nthe rain poured down, and the wind made all the windows rattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor thing!” said the old poet, as he went to open the door. There\\r\\nstood a little boy, quite naked, and the water ran down from his long\\r\\ngolden hair; he trembled with cold, and had he not come into a warm room\\r\\nhe would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor child!” said the old poet, as he took the boy by the hand. “Come\\r\\nin, come in, and I will soon restore thee! Thou shalt have wine and\\r\\nroasted apples, for thou art verily a charming child!” And the boy was\\r\\nso really. His eyes were like two bright stars; and although the water\\r\\ntrickled down his hair, it waved in beautiful curls. He looked exactly\\r\\nlike a little angel, but he was so pale, and his whole body trembled\\r\\nwith cold. He had a nice little bow in his hand, but it was quite\\r\\nspoiled by the rain, and the tints of his many-colored arrows ran one\\r\\ninto the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old poet seated himself beside his hearth, and took the little\\r\\nfellow on his lap; he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair,\\r\\nwarmed his hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine.\\r\\nThen the boy recovered, his cheeks again grew rosy, he jumped down from\\r\\nthe lap where he was sitting, and danced round the kind old poet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a merry fellow,” said the old man. “What's your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Cupid,” answered the boy. “Don't you know me? There lies my\\r\\nbow; it shoots well, I can assure you! Look, the weather is now clearing\\r\\nup, and the moon is shining clear again through the window.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, your bow is quite spoiled,” said the old poet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That were sad indeed,” said the boy, and he took the bow in his hand\\r\\nand examined it on every side. “Oh, it is dry again, and is not hurt at\\r\\nall; the string is quite tight. I will try it directly.” And he bent his\\r\\nbow, took aim, and shot an arrow at the old poet, right into his heart.\\r\\n“You see now that my bow was not spoiled,” said he laughing; and away he\\r\\nran.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe naughty boy, to shoot the old poet in that way; he who had taken him\\r\\ninto his warm room, who had treated him so kindly, and who had given him\\r\\nwarm wine and the very best apples!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor poet lay on the earth and wept, for the arrow had really flown\\r\\ninto his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fie!” said he. “How naughty a boy Cupid is! I will tell all children\\r\\nabout him, that they may take care and not play with him, for he will\\r\\nonly cause them sorrow and many a heartache.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all good children to whom he related this story, took great heed\\r\\nof this naughty Cupid; but he made fools of them still, for he is\\r\\nastonishingly cunning. When the university students come from the\\r\\nlectures, he runs beside them in a black coat, and with a book under his\\r\\narm. It is quite impossible for them to know him, and they walk along\\r\\nwith him arm in arm, as if he, too, were a student like themselves; and\\r\\nthen, unperceived, he thrusts an arrow to their bosom. When the young\\r\\nmaidens come from being examined by the clergyman, or go to church to\\r\\nbe confirmed, there he is again close behind them. Yes, he is forever\\r\\nfollowing people. At the play, he sits in the great chandelier and burns\\r\\nin bright flames, so that people think it is really a flame, but they\\r\\nsoon discover it is something else. He roves about in the garden of the\\r\\npalace and upon the ramparts: yes, once he even shot your father and\\r\\nmother right in the heart. Ask them only and you will hear what they'll\\r\\ntell you. Oh, he is a naughty boy, that Cupid; you must never have\\r\\nanything to do with him. He is forever running after everybody. Only\\r\\nthink, he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother! But that is a\\r\\nlong time ago, and it is all past now; however, a thing of that sort she\\r\\nnever forgets. Fie, naughty Cupid! But now you know him, and you know,\\r\\ntoo, how ill-behaved he is!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RED SHOES\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate, but in\\r\\nsummer she was forced to run about with bare feet, she was so poor, and\\r\\nin winter wear very large wooden shoes, which made her little insteps\\r\\nquite red, and that looked so dangerous!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the village lived old Dame Shoemaker; she sat and sewed\\r\\ntogether, as well as she could, a little pair of shoes out of old red\\r\\nstrips of cloth; they were very clumsy, but it was a kind thought. They\\r\\nwere meant for the little girl. The little girl was called Karen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very day her mother was buried, Karen received the red shoes,\\r\\nand wore them for the first time. They were certainly not intended for\\r\\nmourning, but she had no others, and with stockingless feet she followed\\r\\nthe poor straw coffin in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly a large old carriage drove up, and a large old lady sat in it:\\r\\nshe looked at the little girl, felt compassion for her, and then said to\\r\\nthe clergyman:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here, give me the little girl. I will adopt her!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes, but\\r\\nthe old lady thought they were horrible, and they were burnt. But Karen\\r\\nherself was cleanly and nicely dressed; she must learn to read and sew;\\r\\nand people said she was a nice little thing, but the looking-glass said:\\r\\n“Thou art more than nice, thou art beautiful!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the queen once travelled through the land, and she had her little\\r\\ndaughter with her. And this little daughter was a princess, and people\\r\\nstreamed to the castle, and Karen was there also, and the little\\r\\nprincess stood in her fine white dress, in a window, and let herself be\\r\\nstared at; she had neither a train nor a golden crown, but splendid\\r\\nred morocco shoes. They were certainly far handsomer than those Dame\\r\\nShoemaker had made for little Karen. Nothing in the world can be\\r\\ncompared with red shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Karen was old enough to be confirmed; she had new clothes and was to\\r\\nhave new shoes also. The rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of\\r\\nher little foot. This took place at his house, in his room; where stood\\r\\nlarge glass-cases, filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots. All\\r\\nthis looked charming, but the old lady could not see well, and so had\\r\\nno pleasure in them. In the midst of the shoes stood a pair of red ones,\\r\\njust like those the princess had worn. How beautiful they were! The\\r\\nshoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a count, but had\\r\\nnot fitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That must be patent leather!” said the old lady. “They shine so!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they shine!” said Karen, and they fitted, and were bought, but the\\r\\nold lady knew nothing about their being red, else she would never have\\r\\nallowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed. Yet such was\\r\\nthe case.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody looked at her feet; and when she stepped through the chancel\\r\\ndoor on the church pavement, it seemed to her as if the old figures on\\r\\nthe tombs, those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives, with\\r\\nstiff ruffs, and long black dresses, fixed their eyes on her red shoes.\\r\\nAnd she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her\\r\\nhead, and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and how\\r\\nshe should be now a matured Christian; and the organ pealed so solemnly;\\r\\nthe sweet children's voices sang, and the old music-directors sang, but\\r\\nKaren only thought of her red shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had\\r\\nbeen red, and she said that it was very wrong of Karen, that it was not\\r\\nat all becoming, and that in future Karen should only go in black shoes\\r\\nto church, even when she should be older.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next Sunday there was the sacrament, and Karen looked at the black\\r\\nshoes, looked at the red ones--looked at them again, and put on the red\\r\\nshoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun shone gloriously; Karen and the old lady walked along the path\\r\\nthrough the corn; it was rather dusty there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch, and with a\\r\\nwonderfully long beard, which was more red than white, and he bowed to\\r\\nthe ground, and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes. And\\r\\nKaren stretched out her little foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“See, what beautiful dancing shoes!” said the soldier. “Sit firm when\\r\\nyou dance”; and he put his hand out towards the soles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the old lady gave the old soldier alms, and went into the church\\r\\nwith Karen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all the people in the church looked at Karen's red shoes, and all\\r\\nthe pictures, and as Karen knelt before the altar, and raised the cup to\\r\\nher lips, she only thought of the red shoes, and they seemed to swim\\r\\nin it; and she forgot to sing her psalm, and she forgot to pray, “Our\\r\\nFather in Heaven!”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow all the people went out of church, and the old lady got into her\\r\\ncarriage. Karen raised her foot to get in after her, when the old\\r\\nsoldier said,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look, what beautiful dancing shoes!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Karen could not help dancing a step or two, and when she began her\\r\\nfeet continued to dance; it was just as though the shoes had power over\\r\\nthem. She danced round the church corner, she could not leave off; the\\r\\ncoachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her, and he lifted\\r\\nher in the carriage, but her feet continued to dance so that she trod on\\r\\nthe old lady dreadfully. At length she took the shoes off, and then her\\r\\nlegs had peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shoes were placed in a closet at home, but Karen could not avoid\\r\\nlooking at them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the old lady was sick, and it was said she could not recover. She\\r\\nmust be nursed and waited upon, and there was no one whose duty it was\\r\\nso much as Karen's. But there was a great ball in the city, to which\\r\\nKaren was invited. She looked at the old lady, who could not recover,\\r\\nshe looked at the red shoes, and she thought there could be no sin in\\r\\nit; she put on the red shoes, she might do that also, she thought. But\\r\\nthen she went to the ball and began to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she wanted to dance to the right, the shoes would dance to the\\r\\nleft, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced back\\r\\nagain, down the steps, into the street, and out of the city gate. She\\r\\ndanced, and was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it was suddenly light up among the trees, and she fancied it must\\r\\nbe the moon, for there was a face; but it was the old soldier with\\r\\nthe red beard; he sat there, nodded his head, and said, “Look, what\\r\\nbeautiful dancing shoes!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she was terrified, and wanted to fling off the red shoes, but they\\r\\nclung fast; and she pulled down her stockings, but the shoes seemed to\\r\\nhave grown to her feet. And she danced, and must dance, over fields and\\r\\nmeadows, in rain and sunshine, by night and day; but at night it was the\\r\\nmost fearful.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced over the churchyard, but the dead did not dance--they had\\r\\nsomething better to do than to dance. She wished to seat herself on a\\r\\npoor man's grave, where the bitter tansy grew; but for her there was\\r\\nneither peace nor rest; and when she danced towards the open church\\r\\ndoor, she saw an angel standing there. He wore long, white garments; he\\r\\nhad wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth; his countenance\\r\\nwas severe and grave; and in his hand he held a sword, broad and\\r\\nglittering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dance shalt thou!” said he. “Dance in thy red shoes till thou art pale\\r\\nand cold! Till thy skin shrivels up and thou art a skeleton! Dance shalt\\r\\nthou from door to door, and where proud, vain children dwell, thou shalt\\r\\nknock, that they may hear thee and tremble! Dance shalt thou--!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mercy!” cried Karen. But she did not hear the angel's reply, for the\\r\\nshoes carried her through the gate into the fields, across roads and\\r\\nbridges, and she must keep ever dancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning she danced past a door which she well knew. Within sounded\\r\\na psalm; a coffin, decked with flowers, was borne forth. Then she knew\\r\\nthat the old lady was dead, and felt that she was abandoned by all, and\\r\\ncondemned by the angel of God.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe danced, and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night. The\\r\\nshoes carried her over stack and stone; she was torn till she bled; she\\r\\ndanced over the heath till she came to a little house. Here, she knew,\\r\\ndwelt the executioner; and she tapped with her fingers at the window,\\r\\nand said, “Come out! Come out! I cannot come in, for I am forced to\\r\\ndance!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the executioner said, “Thou dost not know who I am, I fancy? I\\r\\nstrike bad people's heads off; and I hear that my axe rings!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don't strike my head off!” said Karen. “Then I can't repent of my sins!\\r\\nBut strike off my feet in the red shoes!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then she confessed her entire sin, and the executioner struck off\\r\\nher feet with the red shoes, but the shoes danced away with the little\\r\\nfeet across the field into the deep wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he carved out little wooden feet for her, and crutches, taught\\r\\nher the psalm criminals always sing; and she kissed the hand which had\\r\\nwielded the axe, and went over the heath.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now I have suffered enough for the red shoes!” said she. “Now I will\\r\\ngo into the church that people may see me!” And she hastened towards the\\r\\nchurch door: but when she was near it, the red shoes danced before her,\\r\\nand she was terrified, and turned round. The whole week she was unhappy,\\r\\nand wept many bitter tears; but when Sunday returned, she said, “Well,\\r\\nnow I have suffered and struggled enough! I really believe I am as good\\r\\nas many a one who sits in the church, and holds her head so high!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd away she went boldly; but she had not got farther than the\\r\\nchurchyard gate before she saw the red shoes dancing before her; and she\\r\\nwas frightened, and turned back, and repented of her sin from her heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she went to the parsonage, and begged that they would take her\\r\\ninto service; she would be very industrious, she said, and would do\\r\\neverything she could; she did not care about the wages, only she wished\\r\\nto have a home, and be with good people. And the clergyman's wife was\\r\\nsorry for her and took her into service; and she was industrious and\\r\\nthoughtful. She sat still and listened when the clergyman read the Bible\\r\\nin the evenings. All the children thought a great deal of her; but when\\r\\nthey spoke of dress, and grandeur, and beauty, she shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following Sunday, when the family was going to church, they asked\\r\\nher whether she would not go with them; but she glanced sorrowfully,\\r\\nwith tears in her eyes, at her crutches. The family went to hear the\\r\\nword of God; but she went alone into her little chamber; there was only\\r\\nroom for a bed and chair to stand in it; and here she sat down with her\\r\\nPrayer-Book; and whilst she read with a pious mind, the wind bore\\r\\nthe strains of the organ towards her, and she raised her tearful\\r\\ncountenance, and said, “O God, help me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the sun shone so clearly, and straight before her stood the angel\\r\\nof God in white garments, the same she had seen that night at the church\\r\\ndoor; but he no longer carried the sharp sword, but in its stead a\\r\\nsplendid green spray, full of roses. And he touched the ceiling with the\\r\\nspray, and the ceiling rose so high, and where he had touched it there\\r\\ngleamed a golden star. And he touched the walls, and they widened out,\\r\\nand she saw the organ which was playing; she saw the old pictures of the\\r\\npreachers and the preachers' wives. The congregation sat in cushioned\\r\\nseats, and sang out of their Prayer-Books. For the church itself had\\r\\ncome to the poor girl in her narrow chamber, or else she had come into\\r\\nthe church. She sat in the pew with the clergyman's family, and when\\r\\nthey had ended the psalm and looked up, they nodded and said, “It is\\r\\nright that thou art come!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was through mercy!” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the organ pealed, and the children's voices in the choir sounded so\\r\\nsweet and soft! The clear sunshine streamed so warmly through the window\\r\\ninto the pew where Karen sat! Her heart was so full of sunshine, peace,\\r\\nand joy, that it broke. Her soul flew on the sunshine to God, and there\\r\\nno one asked after the RED SHOES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Andersen's Fairy Tales, by Hans Christian Andersen\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n            \""

emperor  who was so excessively fond of\\r\\nnew clothes  that he spent all his money in dress  he did not trouble\\r\\nhimself in the least about his soldiers  nor did he care to go either to\\r\\nthe theatre or the chase  except for the opportunities then afforded him\\r\\nfor displaying his new clothes  he had a different suit for each hour of\\r\\nthe day  and as of any other king or emperor  one is accustomed to say \\r\\n“he is sitting in council ” it was always said of him  “the emperor is\\r\\nsitting in his wardrobe ”\\r\\n\\r\\ntime passed merrily in the large town which was his capital  strangers\\r\\narrived every day at the court  one day  two rogues  calling themselves\\r\\nweavers  made their appearance  they gave out that they knew how to\\r\\nweave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns  the\\r\\nclothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of\\r\\nremaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held  or\\r\\nwho was extraordinarily simple in character \\r\\n\\r\\n“these must  indeed  be splendid clothes ” thought the emperor  “had i\\r\\nsuch a suit  i might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit\\r\\nfor their office  and also be able to distinguish the wise from the\\r\\nfoolish  this stuff must be woven for me immediately ” and he caused\\r\\nlarge sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they\\r\\nmight begin their work directly \\r\\n\\r\\nso the two pretended weavers set up two looms  and affected to work very\\r\\nbusily  though in reality they did nothing at all  they asked for the\\r\\nmost delicate silk and the purest gold thread  put both into their own\\r\\nknapsacks  and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms\\r\\nuntil late at night \\r\\n\\r\\n“i should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth ”\\r\\n said the emperor to himself  after some little time had elapsed  he was \\r\\nhowever  rather embarrassed  when he remembered that a simpleton  or\\r\\none unfit for his office  would be unable to see the manufacture  to be\\r\\nsure  he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person  but yet  he\\r\\nwould prefer sending somebody else  to bring him intelligence about the\\r\\nweavers  and their work  before he troubled himself in the affair  all\\r\\nthe people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the\\r\\ncloth was to possess  and all were anxious to learn how wise  or how\\r\\nignorant  their neighbors might prove to be \\r\\n\\r\\n“i will send my faithful old minister to the weavers ” said the emperor\\r\\nat last  after some deliberation  “he will be best able to see how the\\r\\ncloth looks  for he is a man of sense  and no one can be more suitable\\r\\nfor his office than he is ”\\r\\n\\r\\nso the faithful old minister went into the hall  where the knaves were\\r\\nworking with all their might  at their empty looms  “what can be the\\r\\nmeaning of this?” thought the old man  opening his eyes very wide  “i\\r\\ncannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms ” however  he did\\r\\nnot express his thoughts aloud \\r\\n\\r\\nthe impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come\\r\\nnearer their looms  and then asked him whether the design pleased\\r\\nhim  and whether the colors were not very beautiful  at the same time\\r\\npointing to the empty frames  the poor old minister looked and looked \\r\\nhe could not discover anything on the looms  for a very good reason \\r\\nviz: there was nothing there  “what ” thought he again  “is it possible\\r\\nthat i am a simpleton? i have never thought so myself  and no one must\\r\\nknow it now if i am so  can it be  that i am unfit for my office? no \\r\\nthat must not be said either  i will never confess that i could not see\\r\\nthe stuff ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“well  sir minister ” said one of the knaves  still pretending to work \\r\\n“you do not say whether the stuff pleases you ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  it is excellent ” replied the old minister  looking at the loom\\r\\nthrough his spectacles  “this pattern  and the colors  yes  i will tell\\r\\nthe emperor without delay  how very beautiful i think them ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“we shall be much obliged to you ” said the impostors  and then they\\r\\nnamed the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended\\r\\nstuff  the old minister listened attentively to their words  in order\\r\\nthat he might repeat them to the emperor  and then the knaves asked for\\r\\nmore silk and gold  saying that it was necessary to complete what\\r\\nthey had begun  however  they put all that was given them into their\\r\\nknapsacks  and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as\\r\\nbefore at their empty looms \\r\\n\\r\\nthe emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men\\r\\nwere getting on  and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be\\r\\nready  it was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister \\r\\nhe surveyed the looms on all sides  but could see nothing at all but the\\r\\nempty frames \\r\\n\\r\\n“does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you  as it did to my lord the\\r\\nminister?” asked the impostors of the emperor's second ambassador  at\\r\\nthe same time making the same gestures as before  and talking of the\\r\\ndesign and colors which were not there \\r\\n\\r\\n“i certainly am not stupid ” thought the messenger  “it must be  that i\\r\\nam not fit for my good  profitable office  that is very odd  however  no\\r\\none shall know anything about it ” and accordingly he praised the stuff\\r\\nhe could not see  and declared that he was delighted with both colors\\r\\nand patterns  “indeed  please your imperial majesty ” said he to his\\r\\nsovereign when he returned  “the cloth which the weavers are preparing\\r\\nis extraordinarily magnificent ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the emperor had\\r\\nordered to be woven at his own expense \\r\\n\\r\\nand now the emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture  while\\r\\nit was still in the loom  accompanied by a select number of officers of\\r\\nthe court  among whom were the two honest men who had already admired\\r\\nthe cloth  he went to the crafty impostors  who  as soon as they were\\r\\naware of the emperor's approach  went on working more diligently than\\r\\never  although they still did not pass a single thread through the\\r\\nlooms \\r\\n\\r\\n“is not the work absolutely magnificent?” said the two officers of the\\r\\ncrown  already mentioned  “if your majesty will only be pleased to look\\r\\nat it  what a splendid design  what glorious colors ” and at the same\\r\\ntime they pointed to the empty frames  for they imagined that everyone\\r\\nelse could see this exquisite piece of workmanship \\r\\n\\r\\n“how is this?” said the emperor to himself  “i can see nothing  this\\r\\nis indeed a terrible affair  am i a simpleton  or am i unfit to be an\\r\\nemperor? that would be the worst thing that could happenoh  the cloth\\r\\nis charming ” said he  aloud  “it has my complete approbation ” and he\\r\\nsmiled most graciously  and looked closely at the empty looms  for on no\\r\\naccount would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of\\r\\nhis court had praised so much  all his retinue now strained their eyes \\r\\nhoping to discover something on the looms  but they could see no more\\r\\nthan the others  nevertheless  they all exclaimed  “oh  how beautiful ”\\r\\n and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid\\r\\nmaterial  for the approaching procession  “magnificent  charming \\r\\nexcellent ” resounded on all sides  and everyone was uncommonly gay  the\\r\\nemperor shared in the general satisfaction  and presented the impostors\\r\\nwith the riband of an order of knighthood  to be worn in their\\r\\nbutton-holes  and the title of “gentlemen weavers ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the\\r\\nprocession was to take place  and had sixteen lights burning  so that\\r\\neveryone might see how anxious they were to finish the emperor's new\\r\\nsuit  they pretended to roll the cloth off the looms  cut the air with\\r\\ntheir scissors  and sewed with needles without any thread in them \\r\\n“see ” cried they  at last  “the emperor's new clothes are ready ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand now the emperor  with all the grandees of his court  came to the\\r\\nweavers  and the rogues raised their arms  as if in the act of holding\\r\\nsomething up  saying  “here are your majesty's trousers  here is the\\r\\nscarf  here is the mantle  the whole suit is as light as a cobweb \\r\\none might fancy one has nothing at all on  when dressed in it  that \\r\\nhowever  is the great virtue of this delicate cloth ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes indeed ” said all the courtiers  although not one of them could see\\r\\nanything of this exquisite manufacture \\r\\n\\r\\n“if your imperial majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your\\r\\nclothes  we will fit on the new suit  in front of the looking glass ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe emperor was accordingly undressed  and the rogues pretended to\\r\\narray him in his new suit  the emperor turning round  from side to side \\r\\nbefore the looking glass \\r\\n\\r\\n“how splendid his majesty looks in his new clothes  and how well they\\r\\nfit ” everyone cried out  “what a design  what colors  these are indeed\\r\\nroyal robes ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“the canopy which is to be borne over your majesty  in the procession \\r\\nis waiting ” announced the chief master of the ceremonies \\r\\n\\r\\n“i am quite ready ” answered the emperor  “do my new clothes fit well?”\\r\\n asked he  turning himself round again before the looking glass  in order\\r\\nthat he might appear to be examining his handsome suit \\r\\n\\r\\nthe lords of the bedchamber  who were to carry his majesty's train felt\\r\\nabout on the ground  as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle \\r\\nand pretended to be carrying something  for they would by no means\\r\\nbetray anything like simplicity  or unfitness for their office \\r\\n\\r\\nso now the emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the\\r\\nprocession  through the streets of his capital  and all the people\\r\\nstanding by  and those at the windows  cried out  “oh  how beautiful\\r\\nare our emperor's new clothes  what a magnificent train there is to\\r\\nthe mantle  and how gracefully the scarf hangs ” in short  no one would\\r\\nallow that he could not see these much-admired clothes  because  in\\r\\ndoing so  he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit\\r\\nfor his office  certainly  none of the emperor's various suits  had ever\\r\\nmade so great an impression  as these invisible ones \\r\\n\\r\\n“but the emperor has nothing at all on ” said a little child \\r\\n\\r\\n“listen to the voice of innocence ” exclaimed his father  and what the\\r\\nchild had said was whispered from one to another \\r\\n\\r\\n“but he has nothing at all on ” at last cried out all the people \\r\\nthe emperor was vexed  for he knew that the people were right  but he\\r\\nthought the procession must go on now  and the lords of the bedchamber\\r\\ntook greater pains than ever  to appear holding up a train  although  in\\r\\nreality  there was no train to hold \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe swineherd\\r\\n\\r\\nthere was once a poor prince  who had a kingdom  his kingdom was very\\r\\nsmall  but still quite large enough to marry upon  and he wished to\\r\\nmarry \\r\\n\\r\\nit was certainly rather cool of him to say to the emperor's daughter \\r\\n“will you have me?” but so he did  for his name was renowned far and\\r\\nwide  and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered \\r\\n“yes ” and “thank you kindly ” we shall see what this princess said \\r\\n\\r\\nlisten \\r\\n\\r\\nit happened that where the prince's father lay buried  there grew a rose\\r\\ntreea most beautiful rose tree  which blossomed only once in every\\r\\nfive years  and even then bore only one flower  but that was a rose \\r\\nit smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who\\r\\ninhaled its fragrance \\r\\n\\r\\nand furthermore  the prince had a nightingale  who could sing in such a\\r\\nmanner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little\\r\\nthroat  so the princess was to have the rose  and the nightingale  and\\r\\nthey were accordingly put into large silver caskets  and sent to her \\r\\n\\r\\nthe emperor had them brought into a large hall  where the princess was\\r\\nplaying at “visiting ” with the ladies of the court  and when she saw\\r\\nthe caskets with the presents  she clapped her hands for joy \\r\\n\\r\\n“ah  if it were but a little pussy-cat ” said she  but the rose tree \\r\\nwith its beautiful rose came to view \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  how prettily it is made ” said all the court ladies \\r\\n\\r\\n“it is more than pretty ” said the emperor  “it is charming ”\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the princess touched it  and was almost ready to cry \\r\\n\\r\\n“fie  papa ” said she  “it is not made at all  it is natural ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“let us see what is in the other casket  before we get into a bad\\r\\nhumor ” said the emperor  so the nightingale came forth and sang so\\r\\ndelightfully that at first no one could say anything ill-humored of her \\r\\n\\r\\n“superbe  charmant ” exclaimed the ladies  for they all used to chatter\\r\\nfrench  each one worse than her neighbor \\r\\n\\r\\n“how much the bird reminds me of the musical box that belonged to our\\r\\nblessed empress ” said an old knight  “oh yes  these are the same tones \\r\\nthe same execution ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  yes ” said the emperor  and he wept like a child at the\\r\\nremembrance \\r\\n\\r\\n“i will still hope that it is not a real bird ” said the princess \\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  it is a real bird ” said those who had brought it  “well then let\\r\\nthe bird fly ” said the princess  and she positively refused to see the\\r\\nprince \\r\\n\\r\\nhowever  he was not to be discouraged  he daubed his face over brown and\\r\\nblack  pulled his cap over his ears  and knocked at the door \\r\\n\\r\\n“good day to my lord  the emperor ” said he  “can i have employment at\\r\\nthe palace?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“why  yes ” said the emperor  “i want some one to take care of the pigs \\r\\nfor we have a great many of them ”\\r\\n\\r\\nso the prince was appointed “imperial swineherd ” he had a dirty little\\r\\nroom close by the pigsty  and there he sat the whole day  and worked  by\\r\\nthe evening he had made a pretty little kitchen-pot  little bells were\\r\\nhung all round it  and when the pot was boiling  these bells tinkled in\\r\\nthe most charming manner  and played the old melody \\r\\n\\r\\n    “ach  du lieber augustin \\r\\n    alles ist weg  weg  weg ”*\\r\\n\\r\\n    * “ah  dear augustine \\r\\n    all is gone  gone  gone ”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbut what was still more curious  whoever held his finger in the smoke of\\r\\nthe kitchen-pot  immediately smelt all the dishes that were cooking on\\r\\nevery hearth in the citythis  you see  was something quite different\\r\\nfrom the rose \\r\\n\\r\\nnow the princess happened to walk that way  and when she heard the tune \\r\\nshe stood quite still  and seemed pleased  for she could play “lieber\\r\\naugustine”  it was the only piece she knew  and she played it with one\\r\\nfinger \\r\\n\\r\\n“why there is my piece ” said the princess  “that swineherd must\\r\\ncertainly have been well educated  go in and ask him the price of the\\r\\ninstrument ”\\r\\n\\r\\nso one of the court-ladies must run in  however  she drew on wooden\\r\\nslippers first \\r\\n\\r\\n“what will you take for the kitchen-pot?” said the lady \\r\\n\\r\\n“i will have ten kisses from the princess ” said the swineherd \\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  indeed ” said the lady \\r\\n\\r\\n“i cannot sell it for less ” rejoined the swineherd \\r\\n\\r\\n“he is an impudent fellow ” said the princess  and she walked on  but\\r\\nwhen she had gone a little way  the bells tinkled so prettily\\r\\n\\r\\n    “ach  du lieber augustin \\r\\n    alles ist weg  weg  weg ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“stay ” said the princess  “ask him if he will have ten kisses from the\\r\\nladies of my court ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“no  thank you ” said the swineherd  “ten kisses from the princess  or i\\r\\nkeep the kitchen-pot myself ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that must not be  either ” said the princess  “but do you all stand\\r\\nbefore me that no one may see us ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the court-ladies placed themselves in front of her  and spread\\r\\nout their dressesthe swineherd got ten kisses  and the princessthe\\r\\nkitchen-pot \\r\\n\\r\\nthat was delightful  the pot was boiling the whole evening  and the\\r\\nwhole of the following day  they knew perfectly well what was cooking at\\r\\nevery fire throughout the city  from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's \\r\\nthe court-ladies danced and clapped their hands \\r\\n\\r\\n“we know who has soup  and who has pancakes for dinner to-day  who has\\r\\ncutlets  and who has eggs  how interesting ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  but keep my secret  for i am an emperor's daughter ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe swineherdthat is to saythe prince  for no one knew that he was\\r\\nother than an ill-favored swineherd  let not a day pass without working\\r\\nat something  he at last constructed a rattle  which  when it was swung\\r\\nround  played all the waltzes and jig tunes  which have ever been heard\\r\\nsince the creation of the world \\r\\n\\r\\n“ah  that is superbe ” said the princess when she passed by  “i have\\r\\nnever heard prettier compositions  go in and ask him the price of the\\r\\ninstrument  but mind  he shall have no more kisses ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“he will have a hundred kisses from the princess ” said the lady who had\\r\\nbeen to ask \\r\\n\\r\\n“i think he is not in his right senses ” said the princess  and walked\\r\\non  but when she had gone a little way  she stopped again  “one must\\r\\nencourage art ” said she  “i am the emperor's daughter  tell him he\\r\\nshall  as on yesterday  have ten kisses from me  and may take the rest\\r\\nfrom the ladies of the court ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“ohbut we should not like that at all ” said they  “what are you\\r\\nmuttering?” asked the princess  “if i can kiss him  surely you can \\r\\nremember that you owe everything to me ” so the ladies were obliged to\\r\\ngo to him again \\r\\n\\r\\n“a hundred kisses from the princess ” said he  “or else let everyone\\r\\nkeep his own ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“stand round ” said she  and all the ladies stood round her whilst the\\r\\nkissing was going on \\r\\n\\r\\n“what can be the reason for such a crowd close by the pigsty?” said the\\r\\nemperor  who happened just then to step out on the balcony  he rubbed\\r\\nhis eyes  and put on his spectacles  “they are the ladies of the\\r\\ncourt  i must go down and see what they are about ” so he pulled up his\\r\\nslippers at the heel  for he had trodden them down \\r\\n\\r\\nas soon as he had got into the court-yard  he moved very softly  and the\\r\\nladies were so much engrossed with counting the kisses  that all might\\r\\ngo on fairly  that they did not perceive the emperor  he rose on his\\r\\ntiptoes \\r\\n\\r\\n“what is all this?” said he  when he saw what was going on  and he boxed\\r\\nthe princess's ears with his slipper  just as the swineherd was taking\\r\\nthe eighty-sixth kiss \\r\\n\\r\\n“march out ” said the emperor  for he was very angry  and both princess\\r\\nand swineherd were thrust out of the city \\r\\n\\r\\nthe princess now stood and wept  the swineherd scolded  and the rain\\r\\npoured down \\r\\n\\r\\n“alas  unhappy creature that i am ” said the princess  “if i had but\\r\\nmarried the handsome young prince  ah  how unfortunate i am ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the swineherd went behind a tree  washed the black and brown color\\r\\nfrom his face  threw off his dirty clothes  and stepped forth in his\\r\\nprincely robes  he looked so noble that the princess could not help\\r\\nbowing before him \\r\\n\\r\\n“i am come to despise thee ” said he  “thou would'st not have an\\r\\nhonorable prince  thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale \\r\\nbut thou wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake of a trumpery\\r\\nplaything  thou art rightly served ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe then went back to his own little kingdom  and shut the door of his\\r\\npalace in her face  now she might well sing \\r\\n\\r\\n    “ach  du lieber augustin \\r\\n    alles ist weg  weg  weg ”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe real princess\\r\\n\\r\\nthere was once a prince who wished to marry a princess  but then she\\r\\nmust be a real princess  he travelled all over the world in hopes of\\r\\nfinding such a lady  but there was always something wrong  princesses he\\r\\nfound in plenty  but whether they were real princesses it was impossible\\r\\nfor him to decide  for now one thing  now another  seemed to him not\\r\\nquite right about the ladies  at last he returned to his palace quite\\r\\ncast down  because he wished so much to have a real princess for his\\r\\nwife \\r\\n\\r\\none evening a fearful tempest arose  it thundered and lightened  and the\\r\\nrain poured down from the sky in torrents: besides  it was as dark as\\r\\npitch  all at once there was heard a violent knocking at the door  and\\r\\nthe old king  the prince's father  went out himself to open it \\r\\n\\r\\nit was a princess who was standing outside the door  what with the rain\\r\\nand the wind  she was in a sad condition  the water trickled down from\\r\\nher hair  and her clothes clung to her body  she said she was a real\\r\\nprincess \\r\\n\\r\\n“ah  we shall soon see that ” thought the old queen-mother  however  she\\r\\nsaid not a word of what she was going to do  but went quietly into the\\r\\nbedroom  took all the bed-clothes off the bed  and put three little peas\\r\\non the bedstead  she then laid twenty mattresses one upon another over\\r\\nthe three peas  and put twenty feather beds over the mattresses \\r\\n\\r\\nupon this bed the princess was to pass the night \\r\\n\\r\\nthe next morning she was asked how she had slept  “oh  very badly\\r\\nindeed ” she replied  “i have scarcely closed my eyes the whole night\\r\\nthrough  i do not know what was in my bed  but i had something hard\\r\\nunder me  and am all over black and blue  it has hurt me so much ”\\r\\n\\r\\nnow it was plain that the lady must be a real princess  since she had\\r\\nbeen able to feel the three little peas through the twenty mattresses\\r\\nand twenty feather beds  none but a real princess could have had such a\\r\\ndelicate sense of feeling \\r\\n\\r\\nthe prince accordingly made her his wife  being now convinced that he\\r\\nhad found a real princess  the three peas were however put into the\\r\\ncabinet of curiosities  where they are still to be seen  provided they\\r\\nare not lost \\r\\n\\r\\nwasn't this a lady of real delicacy?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe shoes of fortune\\r\\n\\r\\ni  a beginning\\r\\n\\r\\nevery author has some peculiarity in his descriptions or in his style\\r\\nof writing  those who do not like him  magnify it  shrug up their\\r\\nshoulders  and exclaimthere he is again  i  for my part  know very\\r\\nwell how i can bring about this movement and this exclamation  it would\\r\\nhappen immediately if i were to begin here  as i intended to do  with:\\r\\n“rome has its corso  naples its toledo”“ah  that andersen  there he is\\r\\nagain ” they would cry  yet i must  to please my fancy  continue quite\\r\\nquietly  and add: “but copenhagen has its east street ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhere  then  we will stay for the present  in one of the houses not far\\r\\nfrom the new market a party was inviteda very large party  in order \\r\\nas is often the case  to get a return invitation from the others  one\\r\\nhalf of the company was already seated at the card-table  the other half\\r\\nawaited the result of the stereotype preliminary observation of the lady\\r\\nof the house:\\r\\n\\r\\n“now let us see what we can do to amuse ourselves ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthey had got just so far  and the conversation began to crystallise \\r\\nas it could but do with the scanty stream which the commonplace world\\r\\nsupplied  amongst other things they spoke of the middle ages: some\\r\\npraised that period as far more interesting  far more poetical than our\\r\\nown too sober present  indeed councillor knap defended this opinion\\r\\nso warmly  that the hostess declared immediately on his side  and both\\r\\nexerted themselves with unwearied eloquence  the councillor boldly\\r\\ndeclared the time of king hans to be the noblest and the most happy\\r\\nperiod *\\r\\n\\r\\n* a d  1482-1513\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile the conversation turned on this subject  and was only for a moment\\r\\ninterrupted by the arrival of a journal that contained nothing worth\\r\\nreading  we will just step out into the antechamber  where cloaks \\r\\nmackintoshes  sticks  umbrellas  and shoes  were deposited  here sat two\\r\\nfemale figures  a young and an old one  one might have thought at first\\r\\nthey were servants come to accompany their mistresses home  but on\\r\\nlooking nearer  one soon saw they could scarcely be mere servants  their\\r\\nforms were too noble for that  their skin too fine  the cut of their\\r\\ndress too striking  two fairies were they  the younger  it is true \\r\\nwas not dame fortune herself  but one of the waiting-maids of her\\r\\nhandmaidens who carry about the lesser good things that she distributes \\r\\nthe other looked extremely gloomyit was care  she always attends to\\r\\nher own serious business herself  as then she is sure of having it done\\r\\nproperly \\r\\n\\r\\nthey were telling each other  with a confidential interchange of ideas \\r\\nwhere they had been during the day  the messenger of fortune had only\\r\\nexecuted a few unimportant commissions  such as saving a new bonnet from\\r\\na shower of rain  etc   but what she had yet to perform was something\\r\\nquite unusual \\r\\n\\r\\n“i must tell you ” said she  “that to-day is my birthday  and in honor\\r\\nof it  a pair of walking-shoes or galoshes has been entrusted to me \\r\\nwhich i am to carry to mankind  these shoes possess the property of\\r\\ninstantly transporting him who has them on to the place or the period\\r\\nin which he most wishes to be  every wish  as regards time or place  or\\r\\nstate of being  will be immediately fulfilled  and so at last man will\\r\\nbe happy  here below ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“do you seriously believe it?” replied care  in a severe tone of\\r\\nreproach  “no  he will be very unhappy  and will assuredly bless the\\r\\nmoment when he feels that he has freed himself from the fatal shoes ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“stupid nonsense ” said the other angrily  “i will put them here by\\r\\nthe door  some one will make a mistake for certain and take the wrong\\r\\noneshe will be a happy man ”\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch was their conversation \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nii  what happened to the councillor\\r\\n\\r\\nit was late  councillor knap  deeply occupied with the times of king\\r\\nhans  intended to go home  and malicious fate managed matters so that\\r\\nhis feet  instead of finding their way to his own galoshes  slipped\\r\\ninto those of fortune  thus caparisoned the good man walked out of the\\r\\nwell-lighted rooms into east street  by the magic power of the shoes he\\r\\nwas carried back to the times of king hans  on which account his foot\\r\\nvery naturally sank in the mud and puddles of the street  there having\\r\\nbeen in those days no pavement in copenhagen \\r\\n\\r\\n“well  this is too bad  how dirty it is here ” sighed the councillor \\r\\n“as to a pavement  i can find no traces of one  and all the lamps  it\\r\\nseems  have gone to sleep ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe moon was not yet very high  it was besides rather foggy  so that\\r\\nin the darkness all objects seemed mingled in chaotic confusion  at the\\r\\nnext corner hung a votive lamp before a madonna  but the light it gave\\r\\nwas little better than none at all  indeed  he did not observe it before\\r\\nhe was exactly under it  and his eyes fell upon the bright colors of the\\r\\npictures which represented the well-known group of the virgin and the\\r\\ninfant jesus \\r\\n\\r\\n“that is probably a wax-work show ” thought he  “and the people delay\\r\\ntaking down their sign in hopes of a late visitor or two ”\\r\\n\\r\\na few persons in the costume of the time of king hans passed quickly by\\r\\nhim \\r\\n\\r\\n“how strange they look  the good folks come probably from a masquerade ”\\r\\n\\r\\nsuddenly was heard the sound of drums and fifes  the bright blaze of a\\r\\nfire shot up from time to time  and its ruddy gleams seemed to contend\\r\\nwith the bluish light of the torches  the councillor stood still  and\\r\\nwatched a most strange procession pass by  first came a dozen drummers \\r\\nwho understood pretty well how to handle their instruments  then came\\r\\nhalberdiers  and some armed with cross-bows  the principal person in the\\r\\nprocession was a priest  astonished at what he saw  the councillor asked\\r\\nwhat was the meaning of all this mummery  and who that man was \\r\\n\\r\\n“that's the bishop of zealand ” was the answer \\r\\n\\r\\n“good heavens  what has taken possession of the bishop?” sighed the\\r\\ncouncillor  shaking his head  it certainly could not be the bishop  even\\r\\nthough he was considered the most absent man in the whole kingdom  and\\r\\npeople told the drollest anecdotes about him  reflecting on the matter \\r\\nand without looking right or left  the councillor went through east\\r\\nstreet and across the habro-platz  the bridge leading to palace square\\r\\nwas not to be found  scarcely trusting his senses  the nocturnal\\r\\nwanderer discovered a shallow piece of water  and here fell in with two\\r\\nmen who very comfortably were rocking to and fro in a boat \\r\\n\\r\\n“does your honor want to cross the ferry to the holme?” asked they \\r\\n\\r\\n“across to the holme ” said the councillor  who knew nothing of the age\\r\\nin which he at that moment was  “no  i am going to christianshafen  to\\r\\nlittle market street ”\\r\\n\\r\\nboth men stared at him in astonishment \\r\\n\\r\\n“only just tell me where the bridge is ” said he  “it is really\\r\\nunpardonable that there are no lamps here  and it is as dirty as if one\\r\\nhad to wade through a morass ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe longer he spoke with the boatmen  the more unintelligible did their\\r\\nlanguage become to him \\r\\n\\r\\n“i don't understand your bornholmish dialect ” said he at last  angrily \\r\\nand turning his back upon them  he was unable to find the bridge: there\\r\\nwas no railway either  “it is really disgraceful what a state this place\\r\\nis in ” muttered he to himself  never had his age  with which  however \\r\\nhe was always grumbling  seemed so miserable as on this evening  “i'll\\r\\ntake a hackney-coach ” thought he  but where were the hackney-coaches?\\r\\nnot one was to be seen \\r\\n\\r\\n“i must go back to the new market  there  it is to be hoped  i\\r\\nshall find some coaches  for if i don't  i shall never get safe to\\r\\nchristianshafen ”\\r\\n\\r\\nso off he went in the direction of east street  and had nearly got to\\r\\nthe end of it when the moon shone forth \\r\\n\\r\\n“god bless me  what wooden scaffolding is that which they have set up\\r\\nthere?” cried he involuntarily  as he looked at east gate  which  in\\r\\nthose days  was at the end of east street \\r\\n\\r\\nhe found  however  a little side-door open  and through this he went \\r\\nand stepped into our new market of the present time  it was a huge\\r\\ndesolate plain  some wild bushes stood up here and there  while across\\r\\nthe field flowed a broad canal or river  some wretched hovels for the\\r\\ndutch sailors  resembling great boxes  and after which the place was\\r\\nnamed  lay about in confused disorder on the opposite bank \\r\\n\\r\\n“i either behold a fata morgana  or i am regularly tipsy ” whimpered out\\r\\nthe councillor  “but what's this?”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe turned round anew  firmly convinced that he was seriously ill  he\\r\\ngazed at the street formerly so well known to him  and now so strange in\\r\\nappearance  and looked at the houses more attentively: most of them were\\r\\nof wood  slightly put together  and many had a thatched roof \\r\\n\\r\\n“noi am far from well ” sighed he  “and yet i drank only one glass of\\r\\npunch  but i cannot suppose itit was  too  really very wrong to give\\r\\nus punch and hot salmon for supper  i shall speak about it at the first\\r\\nopportunity  i have half a mind to go back again  and say what i suffer \\r\\nbut no  that would be too silly  and heaven only knows if they are up\\r\\nstill ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe looked for the house  but it had vanished \\r\\n\\r\\n“it is really dreadful ” groaned he with increasing anxiety  “i cannot\\r\\nrecognise east street again  there is not a single decent shop from one\\r\\nend to the other  nothing but wretched huts can i see anywhere  just\\r\\nas if i were at ringstead  oh  i am ill  i can scarcely bear myself any\\r\\nlonger  where the deuce can the house be? it must be here on this very\\r\\nspot  yet there is not the slightest idea of resemblance  to such a\\r\\ndegree has everything changed this night  at all events here are some\\r\\npeople up and stirring  oh  oh  i am certainly very ill ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe now hit upon a half-open door  through a chink of which a faint light\\r\\nshone  it was a sort of hostelry of those times  a kind of public-house \\r\\nthe room had some resemblance to the clay-floored halls in holstein  a\\r\\npretty numerous company  consisting of seamen  copenhagen burghers  and\\r\\na few scholars  sat here in deep converse over their pewter cans  and\\r\\ngave little heed to the person who entered \\r\\n\\r\\n“by your leave ” said the councillor to the hostess  who came bustling\\r\\ntowards him  “i've felt so queer all of a sudden  would you have the\\r\\ngoodness to send for a hackney-coach to take me to christianshafen?”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe woman examined him with eyes of astonishment  and shook her head \\r\\nshe then addressed him in german  the councillor thought she did not\\r\\nunderstand danish  and therefore repeated his wish in german  this  in\\r\\nconnection with his costume  strengthened the good woman in the belief\\r\\nthat he was a foreigner  that he was ill  she comprehended directly  so\\r\\nshe brought him a pitcher of water  which tasted certainly pretty strong\\r\\nof the sea  although it had been fetched from the well \\r\\n\\r\\nthe councillor supported his head on his hand  drew a long breath  and\\r\\nthought over all the wondrous things he saw around him \\r\\n\\r\\n“is this the daily news of this evening?” he asked mechanically  as he\\r\\nsaw the hostess push aside a large sheet of paper \\r\\n\\r\\nthe meaning of this councillorship query remained  of course  a riddle\\r\\nto her  yet she handed him the paper without replying  it was a coarse\\r\\nwood-cut  representing a splendid meteor “as seen in the town of\\r\\ncologne ” which was to be read below in bright letters \\r\\n\\r\\n“that is very old ” said the councillor  whom this piece of antiquity\\r\\nbegan to make considerably more cheerful  “pray how did you come into\\r\\npossession of this rare print? it is extremely interesting  although the\\r\\nwhole is a mere fable  such meteorous appearances are to be explained in\\r\\nthis waythat they are the reflections of the aurora borealis  and it\\r\\nis highly probable they are caused principally by electricity ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthose persons who were sitting nearest him and heard his speech \\r\\nstared at him in wonderment  and one of them rose  took off his hat\\r\\nrespectfully  and said with a serious countenance  “you are no doubt a\\r\\nvery learned man  monsieur ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh no ” answered the councillor  “i can only join in conversation on\\r\\nthis topic and on that  as indeed one must do according to the demands\\r\\nof the world at present ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“modestia is a fine virtue ” continued the gentleman  “however  as to\\r\\nyour speech  i must say mihi secus videtur: yet i am willing to suspend\\r\\nmy judicium ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“may i ask with whom i have the pleasure of speaking?” asked the\\r\\ncouncillor \\r\\n\\r\\n“i am a bachelor in theologia ” answered the gentleman with a stiff\\r\\nreverence \\r\\n\\r\\nthis reply fully satisfied the councillor  the title suited the dress \\r\\n“he is certainly ” thought he  “some village schoolmastersome queer\\r\\nold fellow  such as one still often meets with in jutland ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“this is no locus docendi  it is true ” began the clerical gentleman \\r\\n“yet i beg you earnestly to let us profit by your learning  your reading\\r\\nin the ancients is  sine dubio  of vast extent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh yes  i've read something  to be sure ” replied the councillor  “i\\r\\nlike reading all useful works  but i do not on that account despise the\\r\\nmodern ones  'tis only the unfortunate 'tales of every-day life' that i\\r\\ncannot bearwe have enough and more than enough such in reality ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“'tales of every-day life?'” said our bachelor inquiringly \\r\\n\\r\\n“i mean those new fangled novels  twisting and writhing themselves in\\r\\nthe dust of commonplace  which also expect to find a reading public ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh ” exclaimed the clerical gentleman smiling  “there is much wit in\\r\\nthem  besides they are read at court  the king likes the history of sir\\r\\niffven and sir gaudian particularly  which treats of king arthur  and\\r\\nhis knights of the round table  he has more than once joked about it\\r\\nwith his high vassals ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i have not read that novel ” said the councillor  “it must be quite a\\r\\nnew one  that heiberg has published lately ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“no ” answered the theologian of the time of king hans: “that book is\\r\\nnot written by a heiberg  but was imprinted by godfrey von gehmen ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  is that the author's name?” said the councillor  “it is a very\\r\\nold name  and  as well as i recollect  he was the first printer that\\r\\nappeared in denmark ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  he is our first printer ” replied the clerical gentleman hastily \\r\\n\\r\\nso far all went on well  some one of the worthy burghers now spoke of\\r\\nthe dreadful pestilence that had raged in the country a few years back \\r\\nmeaning that of 1484  the councillor imagined it was the cholera that\\r\\nwas meant  which people made so much fuss about  and the discourse\\r\\npassed off satisfactorily enough  the war of the buccaneers of 1490 was\\r\\nso recent that it could not fail being alluded to  the english\\r\\npirates had  they said  most shamefully taken their ships while in the\\r\\nroadstead  and the councillor  before whose eyes the herostratic [*]\\r\\nevent of 1801 still floated vividly  agreed entirely with the others in\\r\\nabusing the rascally english  with other topics he was not so fortunate \\r\\nevery moment brought about some new confusion  and threatened to become\\r\\na perfect babel  for the worthy bachelor was really too ignorant  and\\r\\nthe simplest observations of the councillor sounded to him too daring\\r\\nand phantastical  they looked at one another from the crown of the head\\r\\nto the soles of the feet  and when matters grew to too high a\\r\\npitch  then the bachelor talked latin  in the hope of being better\\r\\nunderstoodbut it was of no use after all \\r\\n\\r\\n     * herostratus  or eratostratusan ephesian  who wantonly\\r\\n     set fire to the famous temple of diana  in order to\\r\\n     commemorate his name by so uncommon an action \\r\\n\\r\\n“what's the matter?” asked the hostess  plucking the councillor by the\\r\\nsleeve  and now his recollection returned  for in the course of the\\r\\nconversation he had entirely forgotten all that had preceded it \\r\\n\\r\\n“merciful god  where am i ” exclaimed he in agony  and while he so\\r\\nthought  all his ideas and feelings of overpowering dizziness  against\\r\\nwhich he struggled with the utmost power of desperation  encompassed\\r\\nhim with renewed force  “let us drink claret and mead  and bremen beer ”\\r\\n shouted one of the guests“and you shall drink with us ”\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo maidens approached  one wore a cap of two staring colors  denoting\\r\\nthe class of persons to which she belonged  they poured out the liquor \\r\\nand made the most friendly gesticulations  while a cold perspiration\\r\\ntrickled down the back of the poor councillor \\r\\n\\r\\n“what's to be the end of this  what's to become of me ” groaned he  but\\r\\nhe was forced  in spite of his opposition  to drink with the rest  they\\r\\ntook hold of the worthy man  who  hearing on every side that he was\\r\\nintoxicated  did not in the least doubt the truth of this certainly\\r\\nnot very polite assertion  but on the contrary  implored the ladies\\r\\nand gentlemen present to procure him a hackney-coach: they  however \\r\\nimagined he was talking russian \\r\\n\\r\\nnever before  he thought  had he been in such a coarse and ignorant\\r\\ncompany  one might almost fancy the people had turned heathens again \\r\\n“it is the most dreadful moment of my life: the whole world is leagued\\r\\nagainst me ” but suddenly it occurred to him that he might stoop down\\r\\nunder the table  and then creep unobserved out of the door  he did so \\r\\nbut just as he was going  the others remarked what he was about  they\\r\\nlaid hold of him by the legs  and now  happily for him  off fell his\\r\\nfatal shoesand with them the charm was at an end \\r\\n\\r\\nthe councillor saw quite distinctly before him a lantern burning  and\\r\\nbehind this a large handsome house  all seemed to him in proper order as\\r\\nusual  it was east street  splendid and elegant as we now see it  he lay\\r\\nwith his feet towards a doorway  and exactly opposite sat the watchman\\r\\nasleep \\r\\n\\r\\n“gracious heaven ” said he  “have i lain here in the street and dreamed?\\r\\nyes  'tis east street  how splendid and light it is  but really it is\\r\\nterrible what an effect that one glass of punch must have had on me ”\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo minutes later  he was sitting in a hackney-coach and driving to\\r\\nfrederickshafen  he thought of the distress and agony he had endured \\r\\nand praised from the very bottom of his heart the happy realityour own\\r\\ntimewhich  with all its deficiencies  is yet much better than that in\\r\\nwhich  so much against his inclination  he had lately been \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\niii  the watchman's adventure\\r\\n\\r\\n“why  there is a pair of galoshes  as sure as i'm alive ” said the\\r\\nwatchman  awaking from a gentle slumber  “they belong no doubt to the\\r\\nlieutenant who lives over the way  they lie close to the door ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe worthy man was inclined to ring and deliver them at the house  for\\r\\nthere was still a light in the window  but he did not like disturbing\\r\\nthe other people in their beds  and so very considerately he left the\\r\\nmatter alone \\r\\n\\r\\n“such a pair of shoes must be very warm and comfortable ” said he  “the\\r\\nleather is so soft and supple ” they fitted his feet as though they\\r\\nhad been made for him  “'tis a curious world we live in ” continued he \\r\\nsoliloquizing  “there is the lieutenant  now  who might go quietly to\\r\\nbed if he chose  where no doubt he could stretch himself at his ease \\r\\nbut does he do it? no  he saunters up and down his room  because \\r\\nprobably  he has enjoyed too many of the good things of this world at\\r\\nhis dinner  that's a happy fellow  he has neither an infirm mother  nor\\r\\na whole troop of everlastingly hungry children to torment him  every\\r\\nevening he goes to a party  where his nice supper costs him nothing:\\r\\nwould to heaven i could but change with him  how happy should i be ”\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile expressing his wish  the charm of the shoes  which he had put on \\r\\nbegan to work  the watchman entered into the being and nature of the\\r\\nlieutenant  he stood in the handsomely furnished apartment  and held\\r\\nbetween his fingers a small sheet of rose-colored paper  on which some\\r\\nverses were writtenwritten indeed by the officer himself  for who has\\r\\nnot  at least once in his life  had a lyrical moment? and if one then\\r\\nmarks down one's thoughts  poetry is produced  but here was written:\\r\\n\\r\\n                  oh  were i rich \\r\\n\\r\\n     “oh  were i rich  such was my wish  yea such\\r\\n      when hardly three feet high  i longed for much \\r\\n       oh  were i rich  an officer were i \\r\\n       with sword  and uniform  and plume so high \\r\\n       and the time came  and officer was i \\r\\n     but yet i grew not rich  alas  poor me \\r\\n     have pity  thou  who all man's wants dost see \\r\\n\\r\\n        “i sat one evening sunk in dreams of bliss \\r\\n      a maid of seven years old gave me a kiss \\r\\n       i at that time was rich in poesy\\r\\n       and tales of old  though poor as poor could be \\r\\n       but all she asked for was this poesy \\r\\n     then was i rich  but not in gold  poor me \\r\\n     as thou dost know  who all men's hearts canst see \\r\\n\\r\\n        “oh  were i rich  oft asked i for this boon \\r\\n      the child grew up to womanhood full soon \\r\\n       she is so pretty  clever  and so kind\\r\\n     oh  did she know what's hidden in my mind\\r\\n       a tale of old  would she to me were kind \\r\\n     but i'm condemned to silence  oh  poor me \\r\\n     as thou dost know  who all men's hearts canst see \\r\\n\\r\\n        “oh  were i rich in calm and peace of mind \\r\\n      my grief you then would not here written find \\r\\n       o thou  to whom i do my heart devote \\r\\n       oh read this page of glad days now remote \\r\\n       a dark  dark tale  which i tonight devote \\r\\n     dark is the future now  alas  poor me \\r\\n     have pity thou  who all men's pains dost see ”\\r\\n\\r\\nsuch verses as these people write when they are in love  but no man\\r\\nin his senses ever thinks of printing them  here one of the sorrows of\\r\\nlife  in which there is real poetry  gave itself vent  not that\\r\\nbarren grief which the poet may only hint at  but never depict in its\\r\\ndetailmisery and want: that animal necessity  in short  to snatch\\r\\nat least at a fallen leaf of the bread-fruit tree  if not at the fruit\\r\\nitself  the higher the position in which one finds oneself transplanted \\r\\nthe greater is the suffering  everyday necessity is the stagnant pool of\\r\\nlifeno lovely picture reflects itself therein  lieutenant  love  and\\r\\nlack of moneythat is a symbolic triangle  or much the same as the\\r\\nhalf of the shattered die of fortune  this the lieutenant felt most\\r\\npoignantly  and this was the reason he leant his head against the\\r\\nwindow  and sighed so deeply \\r\\n\\r\\n“the poor watchman out there in the street is far happier than i  he\\r\\nknows not what i term privation  he has a home  a wife  and children \\r\\nwho weep with him over his sorrows  who rejoice with him when he is\\r\\nglad  oh  far happier were i  could i exchange with him my beingwith\\r\\nhis desires and with his hopes perform the weary pilgrimage of life  oh \\r\\nhe is a hundred times happier than i ”\\r\\n\\r\\nin the same moment the watchman was again watchman  it was the shoes\\r\\nthat caused the metamorphosis by means of which  unknown to himself  he\\r\\ntook upon him the thoughts and feelings of the officer  but  as we have\\r\\njust seen  he felt himself in his new situation much less contented \\r\\nand now preferred the very thing which but some minutes before he had\\r\\nrejected  so then the watchman was again watchman \\r\\n\\r\\n“that was an unpleasant dream ” said he  “but 'twas droll enough\\r\\naltogether  i fancied that i was the lieutenant over there: and yet\\r\\nthe thing was not very much to my taste after all  i missed my good old\\r\\nmother and the dear little ones  who almost tear me to pieces for sheer\\r\\nlove ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe seated himself once more and nodded: the dream continued to haunt\\r\\nhim  for he still had the shoes on his feet  a falling star shone in the\\r\\ndark firmament \\r\\n\\r\\n“there falls another star ” said he: “but what does it matter  there\\r\\nare always enough left  i should not much mind examining the little\\r\\nglimmering things somewhat nearer  especially the moon  for that would\\r\\nnot slip so easily through a man's fingers  when we dieso at least\\r\\nsays the student  for whom my wife does the washingwe shall fly about\\r\\nas light as a feather from one such a star to the other  that's  of\\r\\ncourse  not true: but 'twould be pretty enough if it were so  if i could\\r\\nbut once take a leap up there  my body might stay here on the steps for\\r\\nwhat i care ”\\r\\n\\r\\nbeholdthere are certain things in the world to which one ought never\\r\\nto give utterance except with the greatest caution  but doubly careful\\r\\nmust one be when we have the shoes of fortune on our feet  now just\\r\\nlisten to what happened to the watchman \\r\\n\\r\\nas to ourselves  we all know the speed produced by the employment of\\r\\nsteam  we have experienced it either on railroads  or in boats when\\r\\ncrossing the sea  but such a flight is like the travelling of a sloth in\\r\\ncomparison with the velocity with which light moves  it flies nineteen\\r\\nmillion times faster than the best race-horse  and yet electricity is\\r\\nquicker still  death is an electric shock which our heart receives  the\\r\\nfreed soul soars upwards on the wings of electricity  the sun's light\\r\\nwants eight minutes and some seconds to perform a journey of more than\\r\\ntwenty million of our danish [*] miles  borne by electricity  the soul\\r\\nwants even some minutes less to accomplish the same flight  to it the\\r\\nspace between the heavenly bodies is not greater than the distance\\r\\nbetween the homes of our friends in town is for us  even if they live a\\r\\nshort way from each other  such an electric shock in the heart  however \\r\\ncosts us the use of the body here below  unless  like the watchman of\\r\\neast street  we happen to have on the shoes of fortune \\r\\n\\r\\n     * a danish mile is nearly 4 3/4 english \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nin a few seconds the watchman had done the fifty-two thousand of our\\r\\nmiles up to the moon  which  as everyone knows  was formed out of\\r\\nmatter much lighter than our earth  and is  so we should say  as soft\\r\\nas newly-fallen snow  he found himself on one of the many circumjacent\\r\\nmountain-ridges with which we are acquainted by means of dr  madler's\\r\\n“map of the moon ” within  down it sunk perpendicularly into a caldron \\r\\nabout a danish mile in depth  while below lay a town  whose appearance\\r\\nwe can  in some measure  realize to ourselves by beating the white of\\r\\nan egg in a glass of water  the matter of which it was built was just as\\r\\nsoft  and formed similar towers  and domes  and pillars  transparent and\\r\\nrocking in the thin air  while above his head our earth was rolling like\\r\\na large fiery ball \\r\\n\\r\\nhe perceived immediately a quantity of beings who were certainly what\\r\\nwe call “men”  yet they looked different to us  a far more correct\\r\\nimagination than that of the pseudo-herschel* had created them  and\\r\\nif they had been placed in rank and file  and copied by some skilful\\r\\npainter's hand  one would  without doubt  have exclaimed involuntarily \\r\\n“what a beautiful arabesque ”\\r\\n\\r\\n*this relates to a book published some years ago in germany  and said\\r\\nto be by herschel  which contained a description of the moon and its\\r\\ninhabitants  written with such a semblance of truth that many were\\r\\ndeceived by the imposture \\r\\n\\r\\nprobably a translation of the celebrated moon hoax  written by richard\\r\\na  locke  and originally published in new york \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthey had a language too  but surely nobody can expect that the soul of\\r\\nthe watchman should understand it  be that as it may  it did comprehend\\r\\nit  for in our souls there germinate far greater powers than we poor\\r\\nmortals  despite all our cleverness  have any notion of  does she\\r\\nnot show usshe the queen in the land of enchantmenther astounding\\r\\ndramatic talent in all our dreams? there every acquaintance appears and\\r\\nspeaks upon the stage  so entirely in character  and with the same tone\\r\\nof voice  that none of us  when awake  were able to imitate it  how\\r\\nwell can she recall persons to our mind  of whom we have not thought for\\r\\nyears  when suddenly they step forth “every inch a man ” resembling the\\r\\nreal personages  even to the finest features  and become the heroes\\r\\nor heroines of our world of dreams  in reality  such remembrances are\\r\\nrather unpleasant: every sin  every evil thought  may  like a clock with\\r\\nalarm or chimes  be repeated at pleasure  then the question is if we can\\r\\ntrust ourselves to give an account of every unbecoming word in our heart\\r\\nand on our lips \\r\\n\\r\\nthe watchman's spirit understood the language of the inhabitants of the\\r\\nmoon pretty well  the selenites* disputed variously about our earth \\r\\nand expressed their doubts if it could be inhabited: the air  they said \\r\\nmust certainly be too dense to allow any rational dweller in the moon\\r\\nthe necessary free respiration  they considered the moon alone to\\r\\nbe inhabited: they imagined it was the real heart of the universe or\\r\\nplanetary system  on which the genuine cosmopolites  or citizens of the\\r\\nworld  dwelt  what strange things menno  what strange things selenites\\r\\nsometimes take into their heads \\r\\n\\r\\n* dwellers in the moon \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nabout politics they had a good deal to say  but little denmark must\\r\\ntake care what it is about  and not run counter to the moon  that\\r\\ngreat realm  that might in an ill-humor bestir itself  and dash down a\\r\\nhail-storm in our faces  or force the baltic to overflow the sides of\\r\\nits gigantic basin \\r\\n\\r\\nwe will  therefore  not listen to what was spoken  and on no condition\\r\\nrun in the possibility of telling tales out of school  but we will\\r\\nrather proceed  like good quiet citizens  to east street  and observe\\r\\nwhat happened meanwhile to the body of the watchman \\r\\n\\r\\nhe sat lifeless on the steps: the morning-star * that is to say  the\\r\\nheavy wooden staff  headed with iron spikes  and which had nothing else\\r\\nin common with its sparkling brother in the sky  had glided from his\\r\\nhand  while his eyes were fixed with glassy stare on the moon  looking\\r\\nfor the good old fellow of a spirit which still haunted it \\r\\n\\r\\n*the watchmen in germany  had formerly  and in some places they still\\r\\ncarry with them  on their rounds at night  a sort of mace or club  known\\r\\nin ancient times by the above denomination \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“what's the hour  watchman?” asked a passer-by  but when the watchman\\r\\ngave no reply  the merry roysterer  who was now returning home from a\\r\\nnoisy drinking bout  took it into his head to try what a tweak of the\\r\\nnose would do  on which the supposed sleeper lost his balance  the body\\r\\nlay motionless  stretched out on the pavement: the man was dead  when\\r\\nthe patrol came up  all his comrades  who comprehended nothing of the\\r\\nwhole affair  were seized with a dreadful fright  for dead he was \\r\\nand he remained so  the proper authorities were informed of the\\r\\ncircumstance  people talked a good deal about it  and in the morning the\\r\\nbody was carried to the hospital \\r\\n\\r\\nnow that would be a very pretty joke  if the spirit when it came back\\r\\nand looked for the body in east street  were not to find one  no doubt\\r\\nit would  in its anxiety  run off to the police  and then to the\\r\\n“hue and cry” office  to announce that “the finder will be handsomely\\r\\nrewarded ” and at last away to the hospital  yet we may boldly assert\\r\\nthat the soul is shrewdest when it shakes off every fetter  and every\\r\\nsort of leading-stringthe body only makes it stupid \\r\\n\\r\\nthe seemingly dead body of the watchman wandered  as we have said  to\\r\\nthe hospital  where it was brought into the general viewing-room:\\r\\nand the first thing that was done here was naturally to pull off the\\r\\ngalosheswhen the spirit  that was merely gone out on adventures  must\\r\\nhave returned with the quickness of lightning to its earthly tenement \\r\\nit took its direction towards the body in a straight line  and a few\\r\\nseconds after  life began to show itself in the man  he asserted that\\r\\nthe preceding night had been the worst that ever the malice of fate had\\r\\nallotted him  he would not for two silver marks again go through what he\\r\\nhad endured while moon-stricken  but now  however  it was over \\r\\n\\r\\nthe same day he was discharged from the hospital as perfectly cured  but\\r\\nthe shoes meanwhile remained behind \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\niv  a moment of head importancean evening's “dramatic readings”a\\r\\nmost strange journey\\r\\n\\r\\nevery inhabitant of copenhagen knows  from personal inspection  how\\r\\nthe entrance to frederick's hospital looks  but as it is possible that\\r\\nothers  who are not copenhagen people  may also read this little work \\r\\nwe will beforehand give a short description of it \\r\\n\\r\\nthe extensive building is separated from the street by a pretty high\\r\\nrailing  the thick iron bars of which are so far apart  that in\\r\\nall seriousness  it is said  some very thin fellow had of a night\\r\\noccasionally squeezed himself through to go and pay his little visits\\r\\nin the town  the part of the body most difficult to manage on such\\r\\noccasions was  no doubt  the head  here  as is so often the case in\\r\\nthe world  long-headed people get through best  so much  then  for the\\r\\nintroduction \\r\\n\\r\\none of the young men  whose head  in a physical sense only  might be\\r\\nsaid to be of the thickest  had the watch that evening  the rain poured\\r\\ndown in torrents  yet despite these two obstacles  the young man was\\r\\nobliged to go out  if it were but for a quarter of an hour  and as\\r\\nto telling the door-keeper about it  that  he thought  was quite\\r\\nunnecessary  if  with a whole skin  he were able to slip through the\\r\\nrailings  there  on the floor lay the galoshes  which the watchman\\r\\nhad forgotten  he never dreamed for a moment that they were those of\\r\\nfortune  and they promised to do him good service in the wet  so he put\\r\\nthem on  the question now was  if he could squeeze himself through the\\r\\ngrating  for he had never tried before  well  there he stood \\r\\n\\r\\n“would to heaven i had got my head through ” said he  involuntarily  and\\r\\ninstantly through it slipped  easily and without pain  notwithstanding\\r\\nit was pretty large and thick  but now the rest of the body was to be\\r\\ngot through \\r\\n\\r\\n“ah  i am much too stout ” groaned he aloud  while fixed as in a vice \\r\\n“i had thought the head was the most difficult part of the matteroh \\r\\noh  i really cannot squeeze myself through ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe now wanted to pull his over-hasty head back again  but he could not \\r\\nfor his neck there was room enough  but for nothing more  his first\\r\\nfeeling was of anger  his next that his temper fell to zero  the\\r\\nshoes of fortune had placed him in the most dreadful situation  and \\r\\nunfortunately  it never occurred to him to wish himself free  the\\r\\npitch-black clouds poured down their contents in still heavier torrents \\r\\nnot a creature was to be seen in the streets  to reach up to the bell\\r\\nwas what he did not like  to cry aloud for help would have availed him\\r\\nlittle  besides  how ashamed would he have been to be found caught in a\\r\\ntrap  like an outwitted fox  how was he to twist himself through  he saw\\r\\nclearly that it was his irrevocable destiny to remain a prisoner till\\r\\ndawn  or  perhaps  even late in the morning  then the smith must be\\r\\nfetched to file away the bars  but all that would not be done so quickly\\r\\nas he could think about it  the whole charity school  just opposite \\r\\nwould be in motion  all the new booths  with their not very\\r\\ncourtier-like swarm of seamen  would join them out of curiosity  and\\r\\nwould greet him with a wild “hurrah ” while he was standing in his\\r\\npillory: there would be a mob  a hissing  and rejoicing  and jeering \\r\\nten times worse than in the rows about the jews some years ago“oh  my\\r\\nblood is mounting to my brain  'tis enough to drive one mad  i shall go\\r\\nwild  i know not what to do  oh  were i but loose  my dizziness would\\r\\nthen cease  oh  were my head but loose ”\\r\\n\\r\\nyou see he ought to have said that sooner  for the moment he expressed\\r\\nthe wish his head was free  and cured of all his paroxysms of love  he\\r\\nhastened off to his room  where the pains consequent on the fright the\\r\\nshoes had prepared for him  did not so soon take their leave \\r\\n\\r\\nbut you must not think that the affair is over now  it grows much worse \\r\\n\\r\\nthe night passed  the next day also  but nobody came to fetch the shoes \\r\\n\\r\\nin the evening “dramatic readings” were to be given at the little\\r\\ntheatre in king street  the house was filled to suffocation  and among\\r\\nother pieces to be recited was a new poem by h  c  andersen  called  my\\r\\naunt's spectacles  the contents of which were pretty nearly as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n“a certain person had an aunt  who boasted of particular skill in\\r\\nfortune-telling with cards  and who was constantly being stormed by\\r\\npersons that wanted to have a peep into futurity  but she was full of\\r\\nmystery about her art  in which a certain pair of magic spectacles\\r\\ndid her essential service  her nephew  a merry boy  who was his aunt's\\r\\ndarling  begged so long for these spectacles  that  at last  she lent\\r\\nhim the treasure  after having informed him  with many exhortations \\r\\nthat in order to execute the interesting trick  he need only repair to\\r\\nsome place where a great many persons were assembled  and then  from a\\r\\nhigher position  whence he could overlook the crowd  pass the company in\\r\\nreview before him through his spectacles  immediately 'the inner man' of\\r\\neach individual would be displayed before him  like a game of cards  in\\r\\nwhich he unerringly might read what the future of every person presented\\r\\nwas to be  well pleased the little magician hastened away to prove the\\r\\npowers of the spectacles in the theatre  no place seeming to him more\\r\\nfitted for such a trial  he begged permission of the worthy audience \\r\\nand set his spectacles on his nose  a motley phantasmagoria presents\\r\\nitself before him  which he describes in a few satirical touches  yet\\r\\nwithout expressing his opinion openly: he tells the people enough to set\\r\\nthem all thinking and guessing  but in order to hurt nobody  he wraps\\r\\nhis witty oracular judgments in a transparent veil  or rather in a lurid\\r\\nthundercloud  shooting forth bright sparks of wit  that they may fall in\\r\\nthe powder-magazine of the expectant audience ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe humorous poem was admirably recited  and the speaker much applauded \\r\\namong the audience was the young man of the hospital  who seemed to have\\r\\nforgotten his adventure of the preceding night  he had on the shoes  for\\r\\nas yet no lawful owner had appeared to claim them  and besides it was so\\r\\nvery dirty out-of-doors  they were just the thing for him  he thought \\r\\n\\r\\nthe beginning of the poem he praised with great generosity: he even\\r\\nfound the idea original and effective  but that the end of it  like the\\r\\nrhine  was very insignificant  proved  in his opinion  the author's\\r\\nwant of invention  he was without genius  etc  this was an excellent\\r\\nopportunity to have said something clever \\r\\n\\r\\nmeanwhile he was haunted by the ideahe should like to possess such a\\r\\npair of spectacles himself  then  perhaps  by using them circumspectly \\r\\none would be able to look into people's hearts  which  he thought  would\\r\\nbe far more interesting than merely to see what was to happen next year \\r\\nfor that we should all know in proper time  but the other never \\r\\n\\r\\n“i can now ” said he to himself  “fancy the whole row of ladies and\\r\\ngentlemen sitting there in the front row  if one could but see into\\r\\ntheir heartsyes  that would be a revelationa sort of bazar  in that\\r\\nlady yonder  so strangely dressed  i should find for certain a large\\r\\nmilliner's shop  in that one the shop is empty  but it wants cleaning\\r\\nplain enough  but there would also be some good stately shops among\\r\\nthem  alas ” sighed he  “i know one in which all is stately  but there\\r\\nsits already a spruce young shopman  which is the only thing that's\\r\\namiss in the whole shop  all would be splendidly decked out  and we\\r\\nshould hear  'walk in  gentlemen  pray walk in  here you will find all\\r\\nyou please to want ' ah  i wish to heaven i could walk in and take a\\r\\ntrip right through the hearts of those present ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand behold  to the shoes of fortune this was the cue  the whole man\\r\\nshrunk together and a most uncommon journey through the hearts of the\\r\\nfront row of spectators  now began  the first heart through which he\\r\\ncame  was that of a middle-aged lady  but he instantly fancied himself\\r\\nin the room of the “institution for the cure of the crooked and\\r\\ndeformed ” where casts of mis-shapen limbs are displayed in naked\\r\\nreality on the wall  yet there was this difference  in the institution\\r\\nthe casts were taken at the entry of the patient  but here they were\\r\\nretained and guarded in the heart while the sound persons went away \\r\\nthey were  namely  casts of female friends  whose bodily or mental\\r\\ndeformities were here most faithfully preserved \\r\\n\\r\\nwith the snake-like writhings of an idea he glided into another female\\r\\nheart  but this seemed to him like a large holy fane  [*] the white dove of\\r\\ninnocence fluttered over the altar  how gladly would he have sunk upon\\r\\nhis knees  but he must away to the next heart  yet he still heard the\\r\\npealing tones of the organ  and he himself seemed to have become a newer\\r\\nand a better man  he felt unworthy to tread the neighboring sanctuary\\r\\nwhich a poor garret  with a sick bed-rid mother  revealed  but god's\\r\\nwarm sun streamed through the open window  lovely roses nodded from\\r\\nthe wooden flower-boxes on the roof  and two sky-blue birds sang\\r\\nrejoicingly  while the sick mother implored god's richest blessings on\\r\\nher pious daughter \\r\\n\\r\\n     * temple\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nhe now crept on hands and feet through a butcher's shop  at least on\\r\\nevery side  and above and below  there was nought but flesh  it was the\\r\\nheart of a most respectable rich man  whose name is certain to be found\\r\\nin the directory \\r\\n\\r\\nhe was now in the heart of the wife of this worthy gentleman  it was an\\r\\nold  dilapidated  mouldering dovecot  the husband's portrait was used as\\r\\na weather-cock  which was connected in some way or other with the doors \\r\\nand so they opened and shut of their own accord  whenever the stern old\\r\\nhusband turned round \\r\\n\\r\\nhereupon he wandered into a boudoir formed entirely of mirrors  like\\r\\nthe one in castle rosenburg  but here the glasses magnified to an\\r\\nastonishing degree  on the floor  in the middle of the room  sat  like a\\r\\ndalai-lama  the insignificant “self” of the person  quite confounded at\\r\\nhis own greatness  he then imagined he had got into a needle-case full\\r\\nof pointed needles of every size \\r\\n\\r\\n“this is certainly the heart of an old maid ” thought he  but he was\\r\\nmistaken  it was the heart of a young military man  a man  as people\\r\\nsaid  of talent and feeling \\r\\n\\r\\nin the greatest perplexity  he now came out of the last heart in the\\r\\nrow  he was unable to put his thoughts in order  and fancied that his\\r\\ntoo lively imagination had run away with him \\r\\n\\r\\n“good heavens ” sighed he  “i have surely a disposition to madness'tis\\r\\ndreadfully hot here  my blood boils in my veins and my head is burning\\r\\nlike a coal ” and he now remembered the important event of the evening\\r\\nbefore  how his head had got jammed in between the iron railings of the\\r\\nhospital  “that's what it is  no doubt ” said he  “i must do something\\r\\nin time: under such circumstances a russian bath might do me good  i\\r\\nonly wish i were already on the upper bank ” [*]\\r\\n\\r\\n     *in these russian (vapor) baths the person extends himself\\r\\n     on a bank or form  and as he gets accustomed to the heat \\r\\n     moves to another higher up towards the ceiling  where  of\\r\\n     course  the vapor is warmest  in this manner he ascends\\r\\n     gradually to the highest \\r\\n\\r\\nand so there he lay on the uppermost bank in the vapor-bath  but with\\r\\nall his clothes on  in his boots and galoshes  while the hot drops fell\\r\\nscalding from the ceiling on his face \\r\\n\\r\\n“holloa ” cried he  leaping down  the bathing attendant  on his side \\r\\nuttered a loud cry of astonishment when he beheld in the bath  a man\\r\\ncompletely dressed \\r\\n\\r\\nthe other  however  retained sufficient presence of mind to whisper to\\r\\nhim  “'tis a bet  and i have won it ” but the first thing he did as soon\\r\\nas he got home  was to have a large blister put on his chest and back to\\r\\ndraw out his madness \\r\\n\\r\\nthe next morning he had a sore chest and a bleeding back  and  excepting\\r\\nthe fright  that was all that he had gained by the shoes of fortune \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv  metamorphosis of the copying-clerk\\r\\n\\r\\nthe watchman  whom we have certainly not forgotten  thought meanwhile\\r\\nof the galoshes he had found and taken with him to the hospital  he now\\r\\nwent to fetch them  and as neither the lieutenant  nor anybody else in\\r\\nthe street  claimed them as his property  they were delivered over to\\r\\nthe police-office *\\r\\n\\r\\n*as on the continent  in all law and police practices nothing is verbal \\r\\nbut any circumstance  however trifling  is reduced to writing  the\\r\\nlabor  as well as the number of papers that thus accumulate  is\\r\\nenormous  in a police-office  consequently  we find copying-clerks among\\r\\nmany other scribes of various denominations  of which  it seems  our\\r\\nhero was one \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“why  i declare the shoes look just like my own ” said one of the\\r\\nclerks  eying the newly-found treasure  whose hidden powers  even he \\r\\nsharp as he was  was not able to discover  “one must have more than\\r\\nthe eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the other ” said he \\r\\nsoliloquizing  and putting  at the same time  the galoshes in search of\\r\\nan owner  beside his own in the corner \\r\\n\\r\\n“here  sir ” said one of the men  who panting brought him a tremendous\\r\\npile of papers \\r\\n\\r\\nthe copying-clerk turned round and spoke awhile with the man about the\\r\\nreports and legal documents in question  but when he had finished  and\\r\\nhis eye fell again on the shoes  he was unable to say whether those to\\r\\nthe left or those to the right belonged to him  “at all events it must\\r\\nbe those which are wet ” thought he  but this time  in spite of his\\r\\ncleverness  he guessed quite wrong  for it was just those of fortune\\r\\nwhich played as it were into his hands  or rather on his feet  and why \\r\\ni should like to know  are the police never to be wrong? so he put them\\r\\non quickly  stuck his papers in his pocket  and took besides a few under\\r\\nhis arm  intending to look them through at home to make the necessary\\r\\nnotes  it was noon  and the weather  that had threatened rain  began\\r\\nto clear up  while gaily dressed holiday folks filled the streets  “a\\r\\nlittle trip to fredericksburg would do me no great harm ” thought he \\r\\n“for i  poor beast of burden that i am  have so much to annoy me  that i\\r\\ndon't know what a good appetite is  'tis a bitter crust  alas  at which\\r\\ni am condemned to gnaw ”\\r\\n\\r\\nnobody could be more steady or quiet than this young man  we therefore\\r\\nwish him joy of the excursion with all our heart  and it will certainly\\r\\nbe beneficial for a person who leads so sedentary a life  in the park\\r\\nhe met a friend  one of our young poets  who told him that the following\\r\\nday he should set out on his long-intended tour \\r\\n\\r\\n“so you are going away again ” said the clerk  “you are a very free\\r\\nand happy being  we others are chained by the leg and held fast to our\\r\\ndesk ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  but it is a chain  friend  which ensures you the blessed bread\\r\\nof existence ” answered the poet  “you need feel no care for the coming\\r\\nmorrow: when you are old  you receive a pension ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“true ” said the clerk  shrugging his shoulders  “and yet you are\\r\\nthe better off  to sit at one's ease and poetisethat is a pleasure \\r\\neverybody has something agreeable to say to you  and you are always your\\r\\nown master  no  friend  you should but try what it is to sit from one\\r\\nyear's end to the other occupied with and judging the most trivial\\r\\nmatters ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe poet shook his head  the copying-clerk did the same  each one kept\\r\\nto his own opinion  and so they separated \\r\\n\\r\\n“it's a strange race  those poets ” said the clerk  who was very fond of\\r\\nsoliloquizing  “i should like some day  just for a trial  to take such\\r\\nnature upon me  and be a poet myself  i am very sure i should make\\r\\nno such miserable verses as the others  today  methinks  is a most\\r\\ndelicious day for a poet  nature seems anew to celebrate her awakening\\r\\ninto life  the air is so unusually clear  the clouds sail on so\\r\\nbuoyantly  and from the green herbage a fragrance is exhaled that fills\\r\\nme with delight  for many a year have i not felt as at this moment ”\\r\\n\\r\\nwe see already  by the foregoing effusion  that he is become a poet  to\\r\\ngive further proof of it  however  would in most cases be insipid  for\\r\\nit is a most foolish notion to fancy a poet different from other men \\r\\namong the latter there may be far more poetical natures than many an\\r\\nacknowledged poet  when examined more closely  could boast of  the\\r\\ndifference only is  that the poet possesses a better mental memory  on\\r\\nwhich account he is able to retain the feeling and the thought till they\\r\\ncan be embodied by means of words  a faculty which the others do not\\r\\npossess  but the transition from a commonplace nature to one that is\\r\\nrichly endowed  demands always a more or less breakneck leap over a\\r\\ncertain abyss which yawns threateningly below  and thus must the sudden\\r\\nchange with the clerk strike the reader \\r\\n\\r\\n“the sweet air ” continued he of the police-office  in his dreamy\\r\\nimaginings  “how it reminds me of the violets in the garden of my aunt\\r\\nmagdalena  yes  then i was a little wild boy  who did not go to school\\r\\nvery regularly  o heavens  'tis a long time since i have thought on\\r\\nthose times  the good old soul  she lived behind the exchange  she\\r\\nalways had a few twigs or green shoots in waterlet the winter rage\\r\\nwithout as it might  the violets exhaled their sweet breath  whilst i\\r\\npressed against the windowpanes covered with fantastic frost-work the\\r\\ncopper coin i had heated on the stove  and so made peep-holes \\r\\nwhat splendid vistas were then opened to my view  what changewhat\\r\\nmagnificence  yonder in the canal lay the ships frozen up  and deserted\\r\\nby their whole crews  with a screaming crow for the sole occupant  but\\r\\nwhen the spring  with a gentle stirring motion  announced her arrival \\r\\na new and busy life arose  with songs and hurrahs the ice was sawn\\r\\nasunder  the ships were fresh tarred and rigged  that they might sail\\r\\naway to distant lands  but i have remained heremust always remain\\r\\nhere  sitting at my desk in the office  and patiently see other people\\r\\nfetch their passports to go abroad  such is my fate  alas ”sighed he \\r\\nand was again silent  “great heaven  what is come to me  never have i\\r\\nthought or felt like this before  it must be the summer air that affects\\r\\nme with feelings almost as disquieting as they are refreshing ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe felt in his pocket for the papers  “these police-reports will soon\\r\\nstem the torrent of my ideas  and effectually hinder any rebellious\\r\\noverflowing of the time-worn banks of official duties”  he said to\\r\\nhimself consolingly  while his eye ran over the first page  “dame\\r\\ntigbrith  tragedy in five acts ” “what is that? and yet it is undeniably\\r\\nmy own handwriting  have i written the tragedy? wonderful  very\\r\\nwonderful and thiswhat have i here? 'intrigue on the ramparts  or\\r\\nthe day of repentance: vaudeville with new songs to the most favorite\\r\\nairs ' the deuce  where did i get all this rubbish? some one must have\\r\\nslipped it slyly into my pocket for a joke  there is too a letter to me \\r\\na crumpled letter and the seal broken ”\\r\\n\\r\\nyes  it was not a very polite epistle from the manager of a theatre  in\\r\\nwhich both pieces were flatly refused \\r\\n\\r\\n“hem  hem ” said the clerk breathlessly  and quite exhausted he seated\\r\\nhimself on a bank  his thoughts were so elastic  his heart so tender \\r\\nand involuntarily he picked one of the nearest flowers  it is a simple\\r\\ndaisy  just bursting out of the bud  what the botanist tells us after\\r\\na number of imperfect lectures  the flower proclaimed in a minute  it\\r\\nrelated the mythus of its birth  told of the power of the sun-light that\\r\\nspread out its delicate leaves  and forced them to impregnate the air\\r\\nwith their incenseand then he thought of the manifold struggles of\\r\\nlife  which in like manner awaken the budding flowers of feeling in our\\r\\nbosom  light and air contend with chivalric emulation for the love of\\r\\nthe fair flower that bestowed her chief favors on the latter  full of\\r\\nlonging she turned towards the light  and as soon as it vanished  rolled\\r\\nher tender leaves together and slept in the embraces of the air  “it is\\r\\nthe light which adorns me ” said the flower \\r\\n\\r\\n“but 'tis the air which enables thee to breathe ” said the poet's voice \\r\\n\\r\\nclose by stood a boy who dashed his stick into a wet ditch  the drops of\\r\\nwater splashed up to the green leafy roof  and the clerk thought of the\\r\\nmillion of ephemera which in a single drop were thrown up to a height \\r\\nthat was as great doubtless for their size  as for us if we were to\\r\\nbe hurled above the clouds  while he thought of this and of the whole\\r\\nmetamorphosis he had undergone  he smiled and said  “i sleep and dream \\r\\nbut it is wonderful how one can dream so naturally  and know besides so\\r\\nexactly that it is but a dream  if only to-morrow on awaking  i could\\r\\nagain call all to mind so vividly  i seem in unusually good spirits  my\\r\\nperception of things is clear  i feel as light and cheerful as though\\r\\ni were in heaven  but i know for a certainty  that if to-morrow a dim\\r\\nremembrance of it should swim before my mind  it will then seem nothing\\r\\nbut stupid nonsense  as i have often experienced alreadyespecially\\r\\nbefore i enlisted under the banner of the police  for that dispels like\\r\\na whirlwind all the visions of an unfettered imagination  all we hear\\r\\nor say in a dream that is fair and beautiful is like the gold of the\\r\\nsubterranean spirits  it is rich and splendid when it is given us  but\\r\\nviewed by daylight we find only withered leaves  alas ” he sighed quite\\r\\nsorrowful  and gazed at the chirping birds that hopped contentedly from\\r\\nbranch to branch  “they are much better off than i  to fly must be a\\r\\nheavenly art  and happy do i prize that creature in which it is innate \\r\\nyes  could i exchange my nature with any other creature  i fain would be\\r\\nsuch a happy little lark ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe had hardly uttered these hasty words when the skirts and sleeves\\r\\nof his coat folded themselves together into wings  the clothes became\\r\\nfeathers  and the galoshes claws  he observed it perfectly  and laughed\\r\\nin his heart  “now then  there is no doubt that i am dreaming  but i\\r\\nnever before was aware of such mad freaks as these ” and up he flew into\\r\\nthe green roof and sang  but in the song there was no poetry  for the\\r\\nspirit of the poet was gone  the shoes  as is the case with anybody who\\r\\ndoes what he has to do properly  could only attend to one thing at a\\r\\ntime  he wanted to be a poet  and he was one  he now wished to be a\\r\\nmerry chirping bird: but when he was metamorphosed into one  the former\\r\\npeculiarities ceased immediately  “it is really pleasant enough ” said\\r\\nhe: “the whole day long i sit in the office amid the driest\\r\\nlaw-papers  and at night i fly in my dream as a lark in the gardens of\\r\\nfredericksburg  one might really write a very pretty comedy upon it ” he\\r\\nnow fluttered down into the grass  turned his head gracefully on every\\r\\nside  and with his bill pecked the pliant blades of grass  which  in\\r\\ncomparison to his present size  seemed as majestic as the palm-branches\\r\\nof northern africa \\r\\n\\r\\nunfortunately the pleasure lasted but a moment  presently black night\\r\\novershadowed our enthusiast  who had so entirely missed his part of\\r\\ncopying-clerk at a police-office  some vast object seemed to be thrown\\r\\nover him  it was a large oil-skin cap  which a sailor-boy of the quay\\r\\nhad thrown over the struggling bird  a coarse hand sought its way\\r\\ncarefully in under the broad rim  and seized the clerk over the back\\r\\nand wings  in the first moment of fear  he called  indeed  as loud as\\r\\nhe could“you impudent little blackguard  i am a copying-clerk at\\r\\nthe police-office  and you know you cannot insult any belonging to the\\r\\nconstabulary force without a chastisement  besides  you good-for-nothing\\r\\nrascal  it is strictly forbidden to catch birds in the royal gardens of\\r\\nfredericksburg  but your blue uniform betrays where you come from ”\\r\\n this fine tirade sounded  however  to the ungodly sailor-boy like a mere\\r\\n“pippi-pi ” he gave the noisy bird a knock on his beak  and walked on \\r\\n\\r\\nhe was soon met by two schoolboys of the upper classthat is to say as\\r\\nindividuals  for with regard to learning they were in the lowest class\\r\\nin the school  and they bought the stupid bird  so the copying-clerk\\r\\ncame to copenhagen as guest  or rather as prisoner in a family living in\\r\\ngother street \\r\\n\\r\\n“'tis well that i'm dreaming ” said the clerk  “or i really should get\\r\\nangry  first i was a poet  now sold for a few pence as a lark  no doubt\\r\\nit was that accursed poetical nature which has metamorphosed me\\r\\ninto such a poor harmless little creature  it is really pitiable \\r\\nparticularly when one gets into the hands of a little blackguard \\r\\nperfect in all sorts of cruelty to animals: all i should like to know\\r\\nis  how the story will end ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe two schoolboys  the proprietors now of the transformed clerk \\r\\ncarried him into an elegant room  a stout stately dame received them\\r\\nwith a smile  but she expressed much dissatisfaction that a common\\r\\nfield-bird  as she called the lark  should appear in such high society \\r\\nfor to-day  however  she would allow it  and they must shut him in the\\r\\nempty cage that was standing in the window  “perhaps he will amuse my\\r\\ngood polly ” added the lady  looking with a benignant smile at a large\\r\\ngreen parrot that swung himself backwards and forwards most comfortably\\r\\nin his ring  inside a magnificent brass-wired cage  “to-day is polly's\\r\\nbirthday ” said she with stupid simplicity: “and the little brown\\r\\nfield-bird must wish him joy ”\\r\\n\\r\\nmr  polly uttered not a syllable in reply  but swung to and fro with\\r\\ndignified condescension  while a pretty canary  as yellow as gold  that\\r\\nhad lately been brought from his sunny fragrant home  began to sing\\r\\naloud \\r\\n\\r\\n“noisy creature  will you be quiet ” screamed the lady of the house \\r\\ncovering the cage with an embroidered white pocket handkerchief \\r\\n\\r\\n“chirp  chirp ” sighed he  “that was a dreadful snowstorm”  and he\\r\\nsighed again  and was silent \\r\\n\\r\\nthe copying-clerk  or  as the lady said  the brown field-bird  was\\r\\nput into a small cage  close to the canary  and not far from “my good\\r\\npolly ” the only human sounds that the parrot could bawl out\\r\\nwere  “come  let us be men ” everything else that he said was as\\r\\nunintelligible to everybody as the chirping of the canary  except to the\\r\\nclerk  who was now a bird too: he understood his companion perfectly \\r\\n\\r\\n“i flew about beneath the green palms and the blossoming almond-trees ”\\r\\n sang the canary  “i flew around  with my brothers and sisters  over\\r\\nthe beautiful flowers  and over the glassy lakes  where the bright\\r\\nwater-plants nodded to me from below  there  too  i saw many\\r\\nsplendidly-dressed paroquets  that told the drollest stories  and the\\r\\nwildest fairy tales without end ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  those were uncouth birds ” answered the parrot  “they had no\\r\\neducation  and talked of whatever came into their head \\r\\n\\r\\n“if my mistress and all her friends can laugh at what i say  so may you\\r\\ntoo  i should think  it is a great fault to have no taste for what is\\r\\nwitty or amusingcome  let us be men ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“ah  you have no remembrance of love for the charming maidens that\\r\\ndanced beneath the outspread tents beside the bright fragrant flowers?\\r\\ndo you no longer remember the sweet fruits  and the cooling juice in\\r\\nthe wild plants of our never-to-be-forgotten home?” said the former\\r\\ninhabitant of the canary isles  continuing his dithyrambic \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  yes ” said the parrot  “but i am far better off here  i am well\\r\\nfed  and get friendly treatment  i know i am a clever fellow  and that\\r\\nis all i care about  come  let us be men  you are of a poetical nature \\r\\nas it is calledi  on the contrary  possess profound knowledge and\\r\\ninexhaustible wit  you have genius  but clear-sighted  calm discretion\\r\\ndoes not take such lofty flights  and utter such high natural tones \\r\\nfor this they have covered you overthey never do the like to me  for\\r\\ni cost more  besides  they are afraid of my beak  and i have always a\\r\\nwitty answer at hand  come  let us be men ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“o warm spicy land of my birth ” sang the canary bird  “i will sing of\\r\\nthy dark-green bowers  of the calm bays where the pendent boughs\\r\\nkiss the surface of the water  i will sing of the rejoicing of all my\\r\\nbrothers and sisters where the cactus grows in wanton luxuriance ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“spare us your elegiac tones ” said the parrot giggling  “rather speak\\r\\nof something at which one may laugh heartily  laughing is an infallible\\r\\nsign of the highest degree of mental development  can a dog  or a horse\\r\\nlaugh? no  but they can cry  the gift of laughing was given to man\\r\\nalone  ha  ha  ha ” screamed polly  and added his stereotype witticism \\r\\n“come  let us be men ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“poor little danish grey-bird ” said the canary  “you have been caught\\r\\ntoo  it is  no doubt  cold enough in your woods  but there at least\\r\\nis the breath of liberty  therefore fly away  in the hurry they have\\r\\nforgotten to shut your cage  and the upper window is open  fly  my\\r\\nfriend  fly away  farewell ”\\r\\n\\r\\ninstinctively the clerk obeyed  with a few strokes of his wings he was\\r\\nout of the cage  but at the same moment the door  which was only ajar \\r\\nand which led to the next room  began to creak  and supple and creeping\\r\\ncame the large tomcat into the room  and began to pursue him  the\\r\\nfrightened canary fluttered about in his cage  the parrot flapped his\\r\\nwings  and cried  “come  let us be men ” the clerk felt a mortal fright \\r\\nand flew through the window  far away over the houses and streets  at\\r\\nlast he was forced to rest a little \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighboring house had a something familiar about it  a window stood\\r\\nopen  he flew in  it was his own room  he perched upon the table \\r\\n\\r\\n“come  let us be men ” said he  involuntarily imitating the chatter of\\r\\nthe parrot  and at the same moment he was again a copying-clerk  but he\\r\\nwas sitting in the middle of the table \\r\\n\\r\\n“heaven help me ” cried he  “how did i get up hereand so buried in\\r\\nsleep  too? after all  that was a very unpleasant  disagreeable dream\\r\\nthat haunted me  the whole story is nothing but silly  stupid nonsense ”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nvi  the best that the galoshes gave\\r\\n\\r\\nthe following day  early in the morning  while the clerk was still in\\r\\nbed  someone knocked at his door  it was his neighbor  a young divine \\r\\nwho lived on the same floor  he walked in \\r\\n\\r\\n“lend me your galoshes ” said he  “it is so wet in the garden  though\\r\\nthe sun is shining most invitingly  i should like to go out a little ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe got the galoshes  and he was soon below in a little duodecimo garden \\r\\nwhere between two immense walls a plumtree and an apple-tree were\\r\\nstanding  even such a little garden as this was considered in the\\r\\nmetropolis of copenhagen as a great luxury \\r\\n\\r\\nthe young man wandered up and down the narrow paths  as well as the\\r\\nprescribed limits would allow  the clock struck six  without was heard\\r\\nthe horn of a post-boy \\r\\n\\r\\n“to travel  to travel ” exclaimed he  overcome by most painful and\\r\\npassionate remembrances  “that is the happiest thing in the world  that\\r\\nis the highest aim of all my wishes  then at last would the agonizing\\r\\nrestlessness be allayed  which destroys my existence  but it must be\\r\\nfar  far away  i would behold magnificent switzerland  i would travel to\\r\\nitaly  and”\\r\\n\\r\\nit was a good thing that the power of the galoshes worked as\\r\\ninstantaneously as lightning in a powder-magazine would do  otherwise\\r\\nthe poor man with his overstrained wishes would have travelled about\\r\\nthe world too much for himself as well as for us  in short  he was\\r\\ntravelling  he was in the middle of switzerland  but packed up with\\r\\neight other passengers in the inside of an eternally-creaking diligence \\r\\nhis head ached till it almost split  his weary neck could hardly bear\\r\\nthe heavy load  and his feet  pinched by his torturing boots  were\\r\\nterribly swollen  he was in an intermediate state between sleeping and\\r\\nwaking  at variance with himself  with his company  with the country \\r\\nand with the government  in his right pocket he had his letter of\\r\\ncredit  in the left  his passport  and in a small leathern purse some\\r\\ndouble louis d'or  carefully sewn up in the bosom of his waistcoat \\r\\nevery dream proclaimed that one or the other of these valuables was\\r\\nlost  wherefore he started up as in a fever  and the first movement\\r\\nwhich his hand made  described a magic triangle from the right pocket to\\r\\nthe left  and then up towards the bosom  to feel if he had them all safe\\r\\nor not  from the roof inside the carriage  umbrellas  walking-sticks \\r\\nhats  and sundry other articles were depending  and hindered the view \\r\\nwhich was particularly imposing  he now endeavored as well as he\\r\\nwas able to dispel his gloom  which was caused by outward chance\\r\\ncircumstances merely  and on the bosom of nature imbibe the milk of\\r\\npurest human enjoyment \\r\\n\\r\\ngrand  solemn  and dark was the whole landscape around  the gigantic\\r\\npine-forests  on the pointed crags  seemed almost like little tufts of\\r\\nheather  colored by the surrounding clouds  it began to snow  a cold\\r\\nwind blew and roared as though it were seeking a bride \\r\\n\\r\\n“augh ” sighed he  “were we only on the other side the alps  then we\\r\\nshould have summer  and i could get my letters of credit cashed  the\\r\\nanxiety i feel about them prevents me enjoying switzerland  were i but\\r\\non the other side ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand so saying he was on the other side in italy  between florence and\\r\\nrome  lake thracymene  illumined by the evening sun  lay like flaming\\r\\ngold between the dark-blue mountain-ridges  here  where hannibal\\r\\ndefeated flaminius  the rivers now held each other in their green\\r\\nembraces  lovely  half-naked children tended a herd of black swine \\r\\nbeneath a group of fragrant laurel-trees  hard by the road-side \\r\\ncould we render this inimitable picture properly  then would everybody\\r\\nexclaim  “beautiful  unparalleled italy ” but neither the young divine\\r\\nsaid so  nor anyone of his grumbling companions in the coach of the\\r\\nvetturino \\r\\n\\r\\nthe poisonous flies and gnats swarmed around by thousands  in vain one\\r\\nwaved myrtle-branches about like mad  the audacious insect population\\r\\ndid not cease to sting  nor was there a single person in the\\r\\nwell-crammed carriage whose face was not swollen and sore from their\\r\\nravenous bites  the poor horses  tortured almost to death  suffered most\\r\\nfrom this truly egyptian plague  the flies alighted upon them in large\\r\\ndisgusting swarms  and if the coachman got down and scraped them off \\r\\nhardly a minute elapsed before they were there again  the sun now set: a\\r\\nfreezing cold  though of short duration pervaded the whole creation \\r\\nit was like a horrid gust coming from a burial-vault on a warm summer's\\r\\ndaybut all around the mountains retained that wonderful green tone\\r\\nwhich we see in some old pictures  and which  should we not have seen a\\r\\nsimilar play of color in the south  we declare at once to be unnatural \\r\\nit was a glorious prospect  but the stomach was empty  the body tired \\r\\nall that the heart cared and longed for was good night-quarters  yet\\r\\nhow would they be? for these one looked much more anxiously than for the\\r\\ncharms of nature  which every where were so profusely displayed \\r\\n\\r\\nthe road led through an olive-grove  and here the solitary inn was\\r\\nsituated  ten or twelve crippled-beggars had encamped outside  the\\r\\nhealthiest of them resembled  to use an expression of marryat's \\r\\n“hunger's eldest son when he had come of age”  the others were either\\r\\nblind  had withered legs and crept about on their hands  or withered\\r\\narms and fingerless hands  it was the most wretched misery  dragged\\r\\nfrom among the filthiest rags  “excellenza  miserabili ” sighed they \\r\\nthrusting forth their deformed limbs to view  even the hostess  with\\r\\nbare feet  uncombed hair  and dressed in a garment of doubtful color \\r\\nreceived the guests grumblingly  the doors were fastened with a loop of\\r\\nstring  the floor of the rooms presented a stone paving half torn\\r\\nup  bats fluttered wildly about the ceiling  and as to the smell\\r\\nthereinnothat was beyond description \\r\\n\\r\\n“you had better lay the cloth below in the stable ” said one of the\\r\\ntravellers  “there  at all events  one knows what one is breathing ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe windows were quickly opened  to let in a little fresh air  quicker \\r\\nhowever  than the breeze  the withered  sallow arms of the beggars were\\r\\nthrust in  accompanied by the eternal whine of “miserabili  miserabili \\r\\nexcellenza ” on the walls were displayed innumerable inscriptions \\r\\nwritten in nearly every language of europe  some in verse  some in\\r\\nprose  most of them not very laudatory of “bella italia ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe meal was served  it consisted of a soup of salted water  seasoned\\r\\nwith pepper and rancid oil  the last ingredient played a very prominent\\r\\npart in the salad  stale eggs and roasted cocks'-combs furnished the\\r\\ngrand dish of the repast  the wine even was not without a disgusting\\r\\ntasteit was like a medicinal draught \\r\\n\\r\\nat night the boxes and other effects of the passengers were placed\\r\\nagainst the rickety doors  one of the travellers kept watch while the\\r\\nothers slept  the sentry was our young divine  how close it was in the\\r\\nchamber  the heat oppressive to suffocationthe gnats hummed and stung\\r\\nunceasinglythe “miserabili” without whined and moaned in their sleep \\r\\n\\r\\n“travelling would be agreeable enough ” said he groaning  “if one only\\r\\nhad no body  or could send it to rest while the spirit went on its\\r\\npilgrimage unhindered  whither the voice within might call it  wherever\\r\\ni go  i am pursued by a longing that is insatiablethat i cannot\\r\\nexplain to myself  and that tears my very heart  i want something better\\r\\nthan what is but what is fled in an instant  but what is it  and where\\r\\nis it to be found? yet  i know in reality what it is i wish for  oh \\r\\nmost happy were i  could i but reach one aimcould but reach the\\r\\nhappiest of all ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand as he spoke the word he was again in his home  the long white\\r\\ncurtains hung down from the windows  and in the middle of the floor\\r\\nstood the black coffin  in it he lay in the sleep of death  his wish\\r\\nwas fulfilledthe body rested  while the spirit went unhindered on its\\r\\npilgrimage  “let no one deem himself happy before his end ” were the\\r\\nwords of solon  and here was a new and brilliant proof of the wisdom of\\r\\nthe old apothegm \\r\\n\\r\\nevery corpse is a sphynx of immortality  here too on the black coffin\\r\\nthe sphynx gave us no answer to what he who lay within had written two\\r\\ndays before:\\r\\n\\r\\n     “o mighty death  thy silence teaches nought \\r\\n       thou leadest only to the near grave's brink \\r\\n      is broken now the ladder of my thoughts?\\r\\n     do i instead of mounting only sink?\\r\\n\\r\\n     our heaviest grief the world oft seeth not \\r\\n      our sorest pain we hide from stranger eyes:\\r\\n      and for the sufferer there is nothing left\\r\\n     but the green mound that o'er the coffin lies ”\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo figures were moving in the chamber  we knew them both  it was the\\r\\nfairy of care  and the emissary of fortune  they both bent over the\\r\\ncorpse \\r\\n\\r\\n“do you now see ” said care  “what happiness your galoshes have brought\\r\\nto mankind?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“to him  at least  who slumbers here  they have brought an imperishable\\r\\nblessing ” answered the other \\r\\n\\r\\n“ah no ” replied care  “he took his departure himself  he was not called\\r\\naway  his mental powers here below were not strong enough to reach the\\r\\ntreasures lying beyond this life  and which his destiny ordained he\\r\\nshould obtain  i will now confer a benefit on him ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand she took the galoshes from his feet  his sleep of death was ended \\r\\nand he who had been thus called back again to life arose from his\\r\\ndread couch in all the vigor of youth  care vanished  and with her the\\r\\ngaloshes  she has no doubt taken them for herself  to keep them to all\\r\\neternity \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fir tree\\r\\n\\r\\nout in the woods stood a nice little fir tree  the place he had was a\\r\\nvery good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air  there was enough\\r\\nof that  and round him grew many large-sized comrades  pines as well as\\r\\nfirs  but the little fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree \\r\\n\\r\\nhe did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air  he did not care\\r\\nfor the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they\\r\\nwere in the woods looking for wild-strawberries  the children often came\\r\\nwith a whole pitcher full of berries  or a long row of them threaded on\\r\\na straw  and sat down near the young tree and said  “oh  how pretty he\\r\\nis  what a nice little fir ” but this was what the tree could not bear\\r\\nto hear \\r\\n\\r\\nat the end of a year he had shot up a good deal  and after another year\\r\\nhe was another long bit taller  for with fir trees one can always tell\\r\\nby the shoots how many years old they are \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  were i but such a high tree as the others are ” sighed he  “then i\\r\\nshould be able to spread out my branches  and with the tops to look into\\r\\nthe wide world  then would the birds build nests among my branches: and\\r\\nwhen there was a breeze  i could bend with as much stateliness as the\\r\\nothers ”\\r\\n\\r\\nneither the sunbeams  nor the birds  nor the red clouds which morning\\r\\nand evening sailed above him  gave the little tree any pleasure \\r\\n\\r\\nin winter  when the snow lay glittering on the ground  a hare would\\r\\noften come leaping along  and jump right over the little tree  oh  that\\r\\nmade him so angry  but two winters were past  and in the third the tree\\r\\nwas so large that the hare was obliged to go round it  “to grow and\\r\\ngrow  to get older and be tall ” thought the tree“that  after all  is\\r\\nthe most delightful thing in the world ”\\r\\n\\r\\nin autumn the wood-cutters always came and felled some of the largest\\r\\ntrees  this happened every year  and the young fir tree  that had now\\r\\ngrown to a very comely size  trembled at the sight  for the magnificent\\r\\ngreat trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking  the branches were\\r\\nlopped off  and the trees looked long and bare  they were hardly to be\\r\\nrecognised  and then they were laid in carts  and the horses dragged\\r\\nthem out of the wood \\r\\n\\r\\nwhere did they go to? what became of them?\\r\\n\\r\\nin spring  when the swallows and the storks came  the tree asked them \\r\\n“don't you know where they have been taken? have you not met them\\r\\nanywhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe swallows did not know anything about it  but the stork looked\\r\\nmusing  nodded his head  and said  “yes  i think i know  i met many\\r\\nships as i was flying hither from egypt  on the ships were magnificent\\r\\nmasts  and i venture to assert that it was they that smelt so of fir \\r\\ni may congratulate you  for they lifted themselves on high most\\r\\nmajestically ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  were i but old enough to fly across the sea  but how does the sea\\r\\nlook in reality? what is it like?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that would take a long time to explain ” said the stork  and with these\\r\\nwords off he went \\r\\n\\r\\n“rejoice in thy growth ” said the sunbeams  “rejoice in thy vigorous\\r\\ngrowth  and in the fresh life that moveth within thee ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the wind kissed the tree  and the dew wept tears over him  but the\\r\\nfir understood it not \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen christmas came  quite young trees were cut down: trees which often\\r\\nwere not even as large or of the same age as this fir tree  who could\\r\\nnever rest  but always wanted to be off  these young trees  and they\\r\\nwere always the finest looking  retained their branches  they were laid\\r\\non carts  and the horses drew them out of the wood \\r\\n\\r\\n“where are they going to?” asked the fir  “they are not taller than\\r\\ni  there was one indeed that was considerably shorter  and why do they\\r\\nretain all their branches? whither are they taken?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“we know  we know ” chirped the sparrows  “we have peeped in at the\\r\\nwindows in the town below  we know whither they are taken  the greatest\\r\\nsplendor and the greatest magnificence one can imagine await them  we\\r\\npeeped through the windows  and saw them planted in the middle of the\\r\\nwarm room and ornamented with the most splendid things  with gilded\\r\\napples  with gingerbread  with toys  and many hundred lights ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“and then?” asked the fir tree  trembling in every bough  “and then?\\r\\nwhat happens then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“we did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career ” cried\\r\\nthe tree  rejoicing  “that is still better than to cross the sea  what\\r\\na longing do i suffer  were christmas but come  i am now tall  and my\\r\\nbranches spread like the others that were carried off last year  oh \\r\\nwere i but already on the cart  were i in the warm room with all the\\r\\nsplendor and magnificence  yes  then something better  something still\\r\\ngrander  will surely follow  or wherefore should they thus ornament me?\\r\\nsomething better  something still grander must followbut what? oh  how\\r\\ni long  how i suffer  i do not know myself what is the matter with me ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“rejoice in our presence ” said the air and the sunlight  “rejoice in\\r\\nthy own fresh youth ”\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the tree did not rejoice at all  he grew and grew  and was green\\r\\nboth winter and summer  people that saw him said  “what a fine tree ”\\r\\n and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down  the axe\\r\\nstruck deep into the very pith  the tree fell to the earth with a sigh \\r\\nhe felt a pangit was like a swoon  he could not think of happiness \\r\\nfor he was sorrowful at being separated from his home  from the place\\r\\nwhere he had sprung up  he well knew that he should never see his dear\\r\\nold comrades  the little bushes and flowers around him  anymore  perhaps\\r\\nnot even the birds  the departure was not at all agreeable \\r\\n\\r\\nthe tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court-yard with\\r\\nthe other trees  and heard a man say  “that one is splendid  we don't\\r\\nwant the others ” then two servants came in rich livery and carried the\\r\\nfir tree into a large and splendid drawing-room  portraits were hanging\\r\\non the walls  and near the white porcelain stove stood two large chinese\\r\\nvases with lions on the covers  there  too  were large easy-chairs \\r\\nsilken sofas  large tables full of picture-books and full of toys  worth\\r\\nhundreds and hundreds of crownsat least the children said so  and the\\r\\nfir tree was stuck upright in a cask that was filled with sand  but no\\r\\none could see that it was a cask  for green cloth was hung all round it \\r\\nand it stood on a large gaily-colored carpet  oh  how the tree quivered \\r\\nwhat was to happen? the servants  as well as the young ladies  decorated\\r\\nit  on one branch there hung little nets cut out of colored paper  and\\r\\neach net was filled with sugarplums  and among the other boughs gilded\\r\\napples and walnuts were suspended  looking as though they had grown\\r\\nthere  and little blue and white tapers were placed among the leaves \\r\\ndolls that looked for all the world like menthe tree had never beheld\\r\\nsuch beforewere seen among the foliage  and at the very top a\\r\\nlarge star of gold tinsel was fixed  it was really splendidbeyond\\r\\ndescription splendid \\r\\n\\r\\n“this evening ” they all said  “how it will shine this evening ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh ” thought the tree  “if the evening were but come  if the tapers\\r\\nwere but lighted  and then i wonder what will happen  perhaps the other\\r\\ntrees from the forest will come to look at me  perhaps the sparrows will\\r\\nbeat against the windowpanes  i wonder if i shall take root here  and\\r\\nwinter and summer stand covered with ornaments ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhe knew very much about the matterbut he was so impatient that for\\r\\nsheer longing he got a pain in his back  and this with trees is the same\\r\\nthing as a headache with us \\r\\n\\r\\nthe candles were now lightedwhat brightness  what splendor  the\\r\\ntree trembled so in every bough that one of the tapers set fire to the\\r\\nfoliage  it blazed up famously \\r\\n\\r\\n“help  help ” cried the young ladies  and they quickly put out the fire \\r\\n\\r\\nnow the tree did not even dare tremble  what a state he was in  he was\\r\\nso uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendor  that he was\\r\\nquite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness  when suddenly both\\r\\nfolding-doors opened and a troop of children rushed in as if they would\\r\\nupset the tree  the older persons followed quietly  the little ones\\r\\nstood quite still  but it was only for a moment  then they shouted that\\r\\nthe whole place re-echoed with their rejoicing  they danced round the\\r\\ntree  and one present after the other was pulled off \\r\\n\\r\\n“what are they about?” thought the tree  “what is to happen now ” and\\r\\nthe lights burned down to the very branches  and as they burned down\\r\\nthey were put out one after the other  and then the children had\\r\\npermission to plunder the tree  so they fell upon it with such violence\\r\\nthat all its branches cracked  if it had not been fixed firmly in the\\r\\nground  it would certainly have tumbled down \\r\\n\\r\\nthe children danced about with their beautiful playthings  no one looked\\r\\nat the tree except the old nurse  who peeped between the branches  but\\r\\nit was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left that had been\\r\\nforgotten \\r\\n\\r\\n“a story  a story ” cried the children  drawing a little fat man towards\\r\\nthe tree  he seated himself under it and said  “now we are in the shade \\r\\nand the tree can listen too  but i shall tell only one story  now which\\r\\nwill you have  that about ivedy-avedy  or about humpy-dumpy  who\\r\\ntumbled downstairs  and yet after all came to the throne and married the\\r\\nprincess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“ivedy-avedy ” cried some  “humpy-dumpy ” cried the others  there was\\r\\nsuch a bawling and screamingthe fir tree alone was silent  and he\\r\\nthought to himself  “am i not to bawl with the rest? am i to do nothing\\r\\nwhatever?” for he was one of the company  and had done what he had to\\r\\ndo \\r\\n\\r\\nand the man told about humpy-dumpy that tumbled down  who\\r\\nnotwithstanding came to the throne  and at last married the princess \\r\\nand the children clapped their hands  and cried  “oh  go on  do go on ”\\r\\n they wanted to hear about ivedy-avedy too  but the little man only told\\r\\nthem about humpy-dumpy  the fir tree stood quite still and absorbed\\r\\nin thought  the birds in the wood had never related the like of this \\r\\n“humpy-dumpy fell downstairs  and yet he married the princess  yes  yes \\r\\nthat's the way of the world ” thought the fir tree  and believed it all \\r\\nbecause the man who told the story was so good-looking  “well  well  who\\r\\nknows  perhaps i may fall downstairs  too  and get a princess as wife ”\\r\\n and he looked forward with joy to the morrow  when he hoped to be decked\\r\\nout again with lights  playthings  fruits  and tinsel \\r\\n\\r\\n“i won't tremble to-morrow ” thought the fir tree  “i will enjoy to\\r\\nthe full all my splendor  to-morrow i shall hear again the story of\\r\\nhumpy-dumpy  and perhaps that of ivedy-avedy too ” and the whole night\\r\\nthe tree stood still and in deep thought \\r\\n\\r\\nin the morning the servant and the housemaid came in \\r\\n\\r\\n“now then the splendor will begin again ” thought the fir  but they\\r\\ndragged him out of the room  and up the stairs into the loft: and here \\r\\nin a dark corner  where no daylight could enter  they left him  “what's\\r\\nthe meaning of this?” thought the tree  “what am i to do here? what\\r\\nshall i hear now  i wonder?” and he leaned against the wall lost in\\r\\nreverie  time enough had he too for his reflections  for days and nights\\r\\npassed on  and nobody came up  and when at last somebody did come  it\\r\\nwas only to put some great trunks in a corner  out of the way  there\\r\\nstood the tree quite hidden  it seemed as if he had been entirely\\r\\nforgotten \\r\\n\\r\\n“'tis now winter out-of-doors ” thought the tree  “the earth is hard and\\r\\ncovered with snow  men cannot plant me now  and therefore i have been\\r\\nput up here under shelter till the spring-time comes  how thoughtful\\r\\nthat is  how kind man is  after all  if it only were not so dark here \\r\\nand so terribly lonely  not even a hare  and out in the woods it was\\r\\nso pleasant  when the snow was on the ground  and the hare leaped by \\r\\nyeseven when he jumped over me  but i did not like it then  it is\\r\\nreally terribly lonely here ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“squeak  squeak ” said a little mouse  at the same moment  peeping out\\r\\nof his hole  and then another little one came  they snuffed about the\\r\\nfir tree  and rustled among the branches \\r\\n\\r\\n“it is dreadfully cold ” said the mouse  “but for that  it would be\\r\\ndelightful here  old fir  wouldn't it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i am by no means old ” said the fir tree  “there's many a one\\r\\nconsiderably older than i am ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“where do you come from ” asked the mice  “and what can you do?” they\\r\\nwere so extremely curious  “tell us about the most beautiful spot on the\\r\\nearth  have you never been there? were you never in the larder  where\\r\\ncheeses lie on the shelves  and hams hang from above  where one dances\\r\\nabout on tallow candles: that place where one enters lean  and comes out\\r\\nagain fat and portly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i know no such place ” said the tree  “but i know the wood  where the\\r\\nsun shines and where the little birds sing ” and then he told all about\\r\\nhis youth  and the little mice had never heard the like before  and they\\r\\nlistened and said \\r\\n\\r\\n“well  to be sure  how much you have seen  how happy you must have\\r\\nbeen ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i ” said the fir tree  thinking over what he had himself related \\r\\n“yes  in reality those were happy times ” and then he told about\\r\\nchristmas-eve  when he was decked out with cakes and candles \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh ” said the little mice  “how fortunate you have been  old fir tree ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i am by no means old ” said he  “i came from the wood this winter  i am\\r\\nin my prime  and am only rather short for my age ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“what delightful stories you know ” said the mice: and the next night\\r\\nthey came with four other little mice  who were to hear what the tree\\r\\nrecounted: and the more he related  the more he remembered himself  and\\r\\nit appeared as if those times had really been happy times  “but they may\\r\\nstill comethey may still come  humpy-dumpy fell downstairs  and yet\\r\\nhe got a princess ” and he thought at the moment of a nice little birch\\r\\ntree growing out in the woods: to the fir  that would be a real charming\\r\\nprincess \\r\\n\\r\\n“who is humpy-dumpy?” asked the mice  so then the fir tree told the\\r\\nwhole fairy tale  for he could remember every single word of it  and the\\r\\nlittle mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the tree  next night\\r\\ntwo more mice came  and on sunday two rats even  but they said the\\r\\nstories were not interesting  which vexed the little mice  and they \\r\\ntoo  now began to think them not so very amusing either \\r\\n\\r\\n“do you know only one story?” asked the rats \\r\\n\\r\\n“only that one ” answered the tree  “i heard it on my happiest evening \\r\\nbut i did not then know how happy i was ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“it is a very stupid story  don't you know one about bacon and tallow\\r\\ncandles? can't you tell any larder stories?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“no ” said the tree \\r\\n\\r\\n“then good-bye ” said the rats  and they went home \\r\\n\\r\\nat last the little mice stayed away also  and the tree sighed: “after\\r\\nall  it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me  and\\r\\nlistened to what i told them  now that too is over  but i will take good\\r\\ncare to enjoy myself when i am brought out again ”\\r\\n\\r\\nbut when was that to be? why  one morning there came a quantity of\\r\\npeople and set to work in the loft  the trunks were moved  the tree was\\r\\npulled out and thrownrather hard  it is truedown on the floor  but a\\r\\nman drew him towards the stairs  where the daylight shone \\r\\n\\r\\n“now a merry life will begin again ” thought the tree  he felt the fresh\\r\\nair  the first sunbeamand now he was out in the courtyard  all passed\\r\\nso quickly  there was so much going on around him  the tree quite forgot\\r\\nto look to himself  the court adjoined a garden  and all was in flower \\r\\nthe roses hung so fresh and odorous over the balustrade  the lindens\\r\\nwere in blossom  the swallows flew by  and said  “quirre-vit  my husband\\r\\nis come ” but it was not the fir tree that they meant \\r\\n\\r\\n“now  then  i shall really enjoy life ” said he exultingly  and spread\\r\\nout his branches  but  alas  they were all withered and yellow  it was\\r\\nin a corner that he lay  among weeds and nettles  the golden star of\\r\\ntinsel was still on the top of the tree  and glittered in the sunshine \\r\\n\\r\\nin the court-yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced\\r\\nat christmas round the fir tree  and were so glad at the sight of him \\r\\none of the youngest ran and tore off the golden star \\r\\n\\r\\n“only look what is still on the ugly old christmas tree ” said he \\r\\ntrampling on the branches  so that they all cracked beneath his feet \\r\\n\\r\\nand the tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers  and the freshness in\\r\\nthe garden  he beheld himself  and wished he had remained in his dark\\r\\ncorner in the loft  he thought of his first youth in the wood  of the\\r\\nmerry christmas-eve  and of the little mice who had listened with so\\r\\nmuch pleasure to the story of humpy-dumpy \\r\\n\\r\\n“'tis over'tis past ” said the poor tree  “had i but rejoiced when i\\r\\nhad reason to do so  but now 'tis past  'tis past ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces  there was a\\r\\nwhole heap lying there  the wood flamed up splendidly under the large\\r\\nbrewing copper  and it sighed so deeply  each sigh was like a shot \\r\\n\\r\\nthe boys played about in the court  and the youngest wore the gold star\\r\\non his breast which the tree had had on the happiest evening of his\\r\\nlife  however  that was over nowthe tree gone  the story at an end \\r\\nall  all was overevery tale must end at last \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe snow queen\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst story  which treats of a mirror and of the splinters\\r\\n\\r\\nnow then  let us begin  when we are at the end of the story  we shall\\r\\nknow more than we know now: but to begin \\r\\n\\r\\nonce upon a time there was a wicked sprite  indeed he was the most\\r\\nmischievous of all sprites  one day he was in a very good humor  for\\r\\nhe had made a mirror with the power of causing all that was good and\\r\\nbeautiful when it was reflected therein  to look poor and mean  but\\r\\nthat which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly was shown magnified\\r\\nand increased in ugliness  in this mirror the most beautiful landscapes\\r\\nlooked like boiled spinach  and the best persons were turned into\\r\\nfrights  or appeared to stand on their heads  their faces were so\\r\\ndistorted that they were not to be recognised  and if anyone had a mole \\r\\nyou might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose\\r\\nand mouth \\r\\n\\r\\n“that's glorious fun ” said the sprite  if a good thought passed through\\r\\na man's mind  then a grin was seen in the mirror  and the sprite laughed\\r\\nheartily at his clever discovery  all the little sprites who went to his\\r\\nschoolfor he kept a sprite schooltold each other that a miracle had\\r\\nhappened  and that now only  as they thought  it would be possible to\\r\\nsee how the world really looked  they ran about with the mirror  and at\\r\\nlast there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted\\r\\nin the mirror  so then they thought they would fly up to the sky \\r\\nand have a joke there  the higher they flew with the mirror  the more\\r\\nterribly it grinned: they could hardly hold it fast  higher and higher\\r\\nstill they flew  nearer and nearer to the stars  when suddenly the\\r\\nmirror shook so terribly with grinning  that it flew out of their hands\\r\\nand fell to the earth  where it was dashed in a hundred million and more\\r\\npieces  and now it worked much more evil than before  for some of these\\r\\npieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand  and they flew about in\\r\\nthe wide world  and when they got into people's eyes  there they stayed \\r\\nand then people saw everything perverted  or only had an eye for that\\r\\nwhich was evil  this happened because the very smallest bit had the\\r\\nsame power which the whole mirror had possessed  some persons even got\\r\\na splinter in their heart  and then it made one shudder  for their heart\\r\\nbecame like a lump of ice  some of the broken pieces were so large that\\r\\nthey were used for windowpanes  through which one could not see one's\\r\\nfriends  other pieces were put in spectacles  and that was a sad affair\\r\\nwhen people put on their glasses to see well and rightly  then the\\r\\nwicked sprite laughed till he almost choked  for all this tickled his\\r\\nfancy  the fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall\\r\\nhear what happened next \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond story  a little boy and a little girl\\r\\n\\r\\nin a large town  where there are so many houses  and so many people \\r\\nthat there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden  and\\r\\nwhere  on this account  most persons are obliged to content themselves\\r\\nwith flowers in pots  there lived two little children  who had a garden\\r\\nsomewhat larger than a flower-pot  they were not brother and sister  but\\r\\nthey cared for each other as much as if they were  their parents lived\\r\\nexactly opposite  they inhabited two garrets  and where the roof of the\\r\\none house joined that of the other  and the gutter ran along the extreme\\r\\nend of it  there was to each house a small window: one needed only to\\r\\nstep over the gutter to get from one window to the other \\r\\n\\r\\nthe children's parents had large wooden boxes there  in which vegetables\\r\\nfor the kitchen were planted  and little rosetrees besides: there was a\\r\\nrose in each box  and they grew splendidly  they now thought of placing\\r\\nthe boxes across the gutter  so that they nearly reached from one window\\r\\nto the other  and looked just like two walls of flowers  the tendrils\\r\\nof the peas hung down over the boxes  and the rose-trees shot up long\\r\\nbranches  twined round the windows  and then bent towards each other: it\\r\\nwas almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers  the boxes were\\r\\nvery high  and the children knew that they must not creep over them  so\\r\\nthey often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other \\r\\nand to sit on their little stools among the roses  where they could play\\r\\ndelightfully  in winter there was an end of this pleasure  the windows\\r\\nwere often frozen over  but then they heated copper farthings on the\\r\\nstove  and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane  and then they had a\\r\\ncapital peep-hole  quite nicely rounded  and out of each peeped a gentle\\r\\nfriendly eyeit was the little boy and the little girl who were looking\\r\\nout  his name was kay  hers was gerda  in summer  with one jump  they\\r\\ncould get to each other  but in winter they were obliged first to\\r\\ngo down the long stairs  and then up the long stairs again: and\\r\\nout-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm \\r\\n\\r\\n“it is the white bees that are swarming ” said kay's old grandmother \\r\\n\\r\\n“do the white bees choose a queen?” asked the little boy  for he knew\\r\\nthat the honey-bees always have one \\r\\n\\r\\n“yes ” said the grandmother  “she flies where the swarm hangs in the\\r\\nthickest clusters  she is the largest of all  and she can never remain\\r\\nquietly on the earth  but goes up again into the black clouds  many a\\r\\nwinter's night she flies through the streets of the town  and peeps in\\r\\nat the windows  and they then freeze in so wondrous a manner that they\\r\\nlook like flowers ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  i have seen it ” said both the children  and so they knew that it\\r\\nwas true \\r\\n\\r\\n“can the snow queen come in?” said the little girl \\r\\n\\r\\n“only let her come in ” said the little boy  “then i'd put her on the\\r\\nstove  and she'd melt ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand then his grandmother patted his head and told him other stories \\r\\n\\r\\nin the evening  when little kay was at home  and half undressed  he\\r\\nclimbed up on the chair by the window  and peeped out of the little\\r\\nhole  a few snow-flakes were falling  and one  the largest of all \\r\\nremained lying on the edge of a flower-pot \\r\\n\\r\\nthe flake of snow grew larger and larger  and at last it was like a\\r\\nyoung lady  dressed in the finest white gauze  made of a million little\\r\\nflakes like stars  she was so beautiful and delicate  but she was of\\r\\nice  of dazzling  sparkling ice  yet she lived  her eyes gazed fixedly \\r\\nlike two stars  but there was neither quiet nor repose in them  she\\r\\nnodded towards the window  and beckoned with her hand  the little boy\\r\\nwas frightened  and jumped down from the chair  it seemed to him as if \\r\\nat the same moment  a large bird flew past the window \\r\\n\\r\\nthe next day it was a sharp frostand then the spring came  the sun\\r\\nshone  the green leaves appeared  the swallows built their nests  the\\r\\nwindows were opened  and the little children again sat in their pretty\\r\\ngarden  high up on the leads at the top of the house \\r\\n\\r\\nthat summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty  the little girl had\\r\\nlearned a hymn  in which there was something about roses  and then she\\r\\nthought of her own flowers  and she sang the verse to the little boy \\r\\nwho then sang it with her:\\r\\n\\r\\n     “the rose in the valley is blooming so sweet \\r\\n     and angels descend there the children to greet ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the children held each other by the hand  kissed the roses  looked\\r\\nup at the clear sunshine  and spoke as though they really saw angels\\r\\nthere  what lovely summer-days those were  how delightful to be out in\\r\\nthe air  near the fresh rose-bushes  that seem as if they would never\\r\\nfinish blossoming \\r\\n\\r\\nkay and gerda looked at the picture-book full of beasts and of birds \\r\\nand it was thenthe clock in the church-tower was just striking\\r\\nfivethat kay said  “oh  i feel such a sharp pain in my heart  and now\\r\\nsomething has got into my eye ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe little girl put her arms around his neck  he winked his eyes  now\\r\\nthere was nothing to be seen \\r\\n\\r\\n“i think it is out now ” said he  but it was not  it was just one of\\r\\nthose pieces of glass from the magic mirror that had got into his eye \\r\\nand poor kay had got another piece right in his heart  it will soon\\r\\nbecome like ice  it did not hurt any longer  but there it was \\r\\n\\r\\n“what are you crying for?” asked he  “you look so ugly  there's nothing\\r\\nthe matter with me  ah ” said he at once  “that rose is cankered  and\\r\\nlook  this one is quite crooked  after all  these roses are very ugly \\r\\nthey are just like the box they are planted in ” and then he gave the\\r\\nbox a good kick with his foot  and pulled both the roses up \\r\\n\\r\\n“what are you doing?” cried the little girl  and as he perceived her\\r\\nfright  he pulled up another rose  got in at the window  and hastened\\r\\noff from dear little gerda \\r\\n\\r\\nafterwards  when she brought her picture-book  he asked  “what horrid\\r\\nbeasts have you there?” and if his grandmother told them stories  he\\r\\nalways interrupted her  besides  if he could manage it  he would get\\r\\nbehind her  put on her spectacles  and imitate her way of speaking  he\\r\\ncopied all her ways  and then everybody laughed at him  he was soon able\\r\\nto imitate the gait and manner of everyone in the street  everything\\r\\nthat was peculiar and displeasing in themthat kay knew how to imitate:\\r\\nand at such times all the people said  “the boy is certainly very\\r\\nclever ” but it was the glass he had got in his eye  the glass that was\\r\\nsticking in his heart  which made him tease even little gerda  whose\\r\\nwhole soul was devoted to him \\r\\n\\r\\nhis games now were quite different to what they had formerly been  they\\r\\nwere so very knowing  one winter's day  when the flakes of snow were\\r\\nflying about  he spread the skirts of his blue coat  and caught the snow\\r\\nas it fell \\r\\n\\r\\n“look through this glass  gerda ” said he  and every flake seemed\\r\\nlarger  and appeared like a magnificent flower  or beautiful star  it\\r\\nwas splendid to look at \\r\\n\\r\\n“look  how clever ” said kay  “that's much more interesting than real\\r\\nflowers  they are as exact as possible  there is not a fault in them  if\\r\\nthey did not melt ”\\r\\n\\r\\nit was not long after this  that kay came one day with large gloves on \\r\\nand his little sledge at his back  and bawled right into gerda's ears \\r\\n“i have permission to go out into the square where the others are\\r\\nplaying”  and off he was in a moment \\r\\n\\r\\nthere  in the market-place  some of the boldest of the boys used to tie\\r\\ntheir sledges to the carts as they passed by  and so they were pulled\\r\\nalong  and got a good ride  it was so capital  just as they were in the\\r\\nvery height of their amusement  a large sledge passed by: it was painted\\r\\nquite white  and there was someone in it wrapped up in a rough white\\r\\nmantle of fur  with a rough white fur cap on his head  the sledge drove\\r\\nround the square twice  and kay tied on his sledge as quickly as he\\r\\ncould  and off he drove with it  on they went quicker and quicker into\\r\\nthe next street  and the person who drove turned round to kay  and\\r\\nnodded to him in a friendly manner  just as if they knew each other \\r\\nevery time he was going to untie his sledge  the person nodded to him \\r\\nand then kay sat quiet  and so on they went till they came outside\\r\\nthe gates of the town  then the snow began to fall so thickly that the\\r\\nlittle boy could not see an arm's length before him  but still on he\\r\\nwent: when suddenly he let go the string he held in his hand in order\\r\\nto get loose from the sledge  but it was of no use  still the little\\r\\nvehicle rushed on with the quickness of the wind  he then cried as loud\\r\\nas he could  but no one heard him  the snow drifted and the sledge flew\\r\\non  and sometimes it gave a jerk as though they were driving over hedges\\r\\nand ditches  he was quite frightened  and he tried to repeat the\\r\\nlord's prayer  but all he could do  he was only able to remember the\\r\\nmultiplication table \\r\\n\\r\\nthe snow-flakes grew larger and larger  till at last they looked just\\r\\nlike great white fowls  suddenly they flew on one side  the large sledge\\r\\nstopped  and the person who drove rose up  it was a lady  her cloak and\\r\\ncap were of snow  she was tall and of slender figure  and of a dazzling\\r\\nwhiteness  it was the snow queen \\r\\n\\r\\n“we have travelled fast ” said she  “but it is freezingly cold  come\\r\\nunder my bearskin ” and she put him in the sledge beside her \\r\\nwrapped the fur round him  and he felt as though he were sinking in a\\r\\nsnow-wreath \\r\\n\\r\\n“are you still cold?” asked she  and then she kissed his forehead \\r\\nah  it was colder than ice  it penetrated to his very heart  which was\\r\\nalready almost a frozen lump  it seemed to him as if he were about to\\r\\ndiebut a moment more and it was quite congenial to him  and he did not\\r\\nremark the cold that was around him \\r\\n\\r\\n“my sledge  do not forget my sledge ” it was the first thing he thought\\r\\nof  it was there tied to one of the white chickens  who flew along with\\r\\nit on his back behind the large sledge  the snow queen kissed kay once\\r\\nmore  and then he forgot little gerda  grandmother  and all whom he had\\r\\nleft at his home \\r\\n\\r\\n“now you will have no more kisses ” said she  “or else i should kiss you\\r\\nto death ”\\r\\n\\r\\nkay looked at her  she was very beautiful  a more clever  or a more\\r\\nlovely countenance he could not fancy to himself  and she no longer\\r\\nappeared of ice as before  when she sat outside the window  and beckoned\\r\\nto him  in his eyes she was perfect  he did not fear her at all  and\\r\\ntold her that he could calculate in his head and with fractions  even \\r\\nthat he knew the number of square miles there were in the different\\r\\ncountries  and how many inhabitants they contained  and she smiled while\\r\\nhe spoke  it then seemed to him as if what he knew was not enough  and\\r\\nhe looked upwards in the large huge empty space above him  and on she\\r\\nflew with him  flew high over the black clouds  while the storm moaned\\r\\nand whistled as though it were singing some old tune  on they flew\\r\\nover woods and lakes  over seas  and many lands  and beneath them the\\r\\nchilling storm rushed fast  the wolves howled  the snow crackled  above\\r\\nthem flew large screaming crows  but higher up appeared the moon  quite\\r\\nlarge and bright  and it was on it that kay gazed during the long long\\r\\nwinter's night  while by day he slept at the feet of the snow queen \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthird story  of the flower-garden at the old woman's who understood\\r\\nwitchcraft\\r\\n\\r\\nbut what became of little gerda when kay did not return? where could he\\r\\nbe? nobody knew  nobody could give any intelligence  all the boys knew\\r\\nwas  that they had seen him tie his sledge to another large and splendid\\r\\none  which drove down the street and out of the town  nobody knew\\r\\nwhere he was  many sad tears were shed  and little gerda wept long and\\r\\nbitterly  at last she said he must be dead  that he had been drowned in\\r\\nthe river which flowed close to the town  oh  those were very long and\\r\\ndismal winter evenings \\r\\n\\r\\nat last spring came  with its warm sunshine \\r\\n\\r\\n“kay is dead and gone ” said little gerda \\r\\n\\r\\n“that i don't believe ” said the sunshine \\r\\n\\r\\n“kay is dead and gone ” said she to the swallows \\r\\n\\r\\n“that i don't believe ” said they: and at last little gerda did not\\r\\nthink so any longer either \\r\\n\\r\\n“i'll put on my red shoes ” said she  one morning  “kay has never seen\\r\\nthem  and then i'll go down to the river and ask there ”\\r\\n\\r\\nit was quite early  she kissed her old grandmother  who was still\\r\\nasleep  put on her red shoes  and went alone to the river \\r\\n\\r\\n“is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? i will make you a\\r\\npresent of my red shoes  if you will give him back to me ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand  as it seemed to her  the blue waves nodded in a strange manner \\r\\nthen she took off her red shoes  the most precious things she possessed \\r\\nand threw them both into the river  but they fell close to the bank  and\\r\\nthe little waves bore them immediately to land  it was as if the stream\\r\\nwould not take what was dearest to her  for in reality it had not got\\r\\nlittle kay  but gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far\\r\\nenough  so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes  went\\r\\nto the farthest end  and threw out the shoes  but the boat was not\\r\\nfastened  and the motion which she occasioned  made it drift from the\\r\\nshore  she observed this  and hastened to get back  but before she could\\r\\ndo so  the boat was more than a yard from the land  and was gliding\\r\\nquickly onward \\r\\n\\r\\nlittle gerda was very frightened  and began to cry  but no one heard her\\r\\nexcept the sparrows  and they could not carry her to land  but they flew\\r\\nalong the bank  and sang as if to comfort her  “here we are  here we\\r\\nare ” the boat drifted with the stream  little gerda sat quite still\\r\\nwithout shoes  for they were swimming behind the boat  but she could not\\r\\nreach them  because the boat went much faster than they did \\r\\n\\r\\nthe banks on both sides were beautiful  lovely flowers  venerable trees \\r\\nand slopes with sheep and cows  but not a human being was to be seen \\r\\n\\r\\n“perhaps the river will carry me to little kay ” said she  and then\\r\\nshe grew less sad  she rose  and looked for many hours at the beautiful\\r\\ngreen banks  presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard  where was\\r\\na little cottage with curious red and blue windows  it was thatched \\r\\nand before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry  and presented arms when\\r\\nanyone went past \\r\\n\\r\\ngerda called to them  for she thought they were alive  but they  of\\r\\ncourse  did not answer  she came close to them  for the stream drifted\\r\\nthe boat quite near the land \\r\\n\\r\\ngerda called still louder  and an old woman then came out of the\\r\\ncottage  leaning upon a crooked stick  she had a large broad-brimmed hat\\r\\non  painted with the most splendid flowers \\r\\n\\r\\n“poor little child ” said the old woman  “how did you get upon the large\\r\\nrapid river  to be driven about so in the wide world ” and then the\\r\\nold woman went into the water  caught hold of the boat with her crooked\\r\\nstick  drew it to the bank  and lifted little gerda out \\r\\n\\r\\nand gerda was so glad to be on dry land again  but she was rather afraid\\r\\nof the strange old woman \\r\\n\\r\\n“but come and tell me who you are  and how you came here ” said she \\r\\n\\r\\nand gerda told her all  and the old woman shook her head and said \\r\\n“a-hem  a-hem ” and when gerda had told her everything  and asked her if\\r\\nshe had not seen little kay  the woman answered that he had not passed\\r\\nthere  but he no doubt would come  and she told her not to be cast down \\r\\nbut taste her cherries  and look at her flowers  which were finer than\\r\\nany in a picture-book  each of which could tell a whole story  she then\\r\\ntook gerda by the hand  led her into the little cottage  and locked the\\r\\ndoor \\r\\n\\r\\nthe windows were very high up  the glass was red  blue  and green  and\\r\\nthe sunlight shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of colors  on\\r\\nthe table stood the most exquisite cherries  and gerda ate as many as\\r\\nshe chose  for she had permission to do so  while she was eating  the\\r\\nold woman combed her hair with a golden comb  and her hair curled and\\r\\nshone with a lovely golden color around that sweet little face  which\\r\\nwas so round and so like a rose \\r\\n\\r\\n“i have often longed for such a dear little girl ” said the old woman \\r\\n“now you shall see how well we agree together”  and while she combed\\r\\nlittle gerda's hair  the child forgot her foster-brother kay more and\\r\\nmore  for the old woman understood magic  but she was no evil being  she\\r\\nonly practised witchcraft a little for her own private amusement  and\\r\\nnow she wanted very much to keep little gerda  she therefore went out\\r\\nin the garden  stretched out her crooked stick towards the rose-bushes \\r\\nwhich  beautifully as they were blowing  all sank into the earth and no\\r\\none could tell where they had stood  the old woman feared that if gerda\\r\\nshould see the roses  she would then think of her own  would remember\\r\\nlittle kay  and run away from her \\r\\n\\r\\nshe now led gerda into the flower-garden  oh  what odour and what\\r\\nloveliness was there  every flower that one could think of  and of every\\r\\nseason  stood there in fullest bloom  no picture-book could be gayer or\\r\\nmore beautiful  gerda jumped for joy  and played till the sun set behind\\r\\nthe tall cherry-tree  she then had a pretty bed  with a red silken\\r\\ncoverlet filled with blue violets  she fell asleep  and had as pleasant\\r\\ndreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day \\r\\n\\r\\nthe next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine \\r\\nand thus passed away a day  gerda knew every flower  and  numerous as\\r\\nthey were  it still seemed to gerda that one was wanting  though she\\r\\ndid not know which  one day while she was looking at the hat of the old\\r\\nwoman painted with flowers  the most beautiful of them all seemed to her\\r\\nto be a rose  the old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat\\r\\nwhen she made the others vanish in the earth  but so it is when one's\\r\\nthoughts are not collected  “what ” said gerda  “are there no roses\\r\\nhere?” and she ran about amongst the flowerbeds  and looked  and looked \\r\\nbut there was not one to be found  she then sat down and wept  but her\\r\\nhot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk  and when her warm tears\\r\\nwatered the ground  the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as\\r\\nwhen it had been swallowed up  gerda kissed the roses  thought of her\\r\\nown dear roses at home  and with them of little kay \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  how long i have stayed ” said the little girl  “i intended to look\\r\\nfor kay  don't you know where he is?” she asked of the roses  “do you\\r\\nthink he is dead and gone?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“dead he certainly is not ” said the roses  “we have been in the earth\\r\\nwhere all the dead are  but kay was not there ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“many thanks ” said little gerda  and she went to the other flowers \\r\\nlooked into their cups  and asked  “don't you know where little kay is?”\\r\\n\\r\\nbut every flower stood in the sunshine  and dreamed its own fairy tale\\r\\nor its own story: and they all told her very many things  but not one\\r\\nknew anything of kay \\r\\n\\r\\nwell  what did the tiger-lily say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“hearest thou not the drum? bum  bum  those are the only two tones \\r\\nalways bum  bum  hark to the plaintive song of the old woman  to the\\r\\ncall of the priests  the hindoo woman in her long robe stands upon the\\r\\nfuneral pile  the flames rise around her and her dead husband  but the\\r\\nhindoo woman thinks on the living one in the surrounding circle  on him\\r\\nwhose eyes burn hotter than the flameson him  the fire of whose eyes\\r\\npierces her heart more than the flames which soon will burn her body to\\r\\nashes  can the heart's flame die in the flame of the funeral pile?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i don't understand that at all ” said little gerda \\r\\n\\r\\n“that is my story ” said the lily \\r\\n\\r\\nwhat did the convolvulus say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“projecting over a narrow mountain-path there hangs an old feudal\\r\\ncastle  thick evergreens grow on the dilapidated walls  and around the\\r\\naltar  where a lovely maiden is standing: she bends over the railing and\\r\\nlooks out upon the rose  no fresher rose hangs on the branches than she \\r\\nno appleblossom carried away by the wind is more buoyant  how her silken\\r\\nrobe is rustling \\r\\n\\r\\n“'is he not yet come?'”\\r\\n\\r\\n“is it kay that you mean?” asked little gerda \\r\\n\\r\\n“i am speaking about my storyabout my dream ” answered the\\r\\nconvolvulus \\r\\n\\r\\nwhat did the snowdrops say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“between the trees a long board is hangingit is a swing  two little\\r\\ngirls are sitting in it  and swing themselves backwards and forwards \\r\\ntheir frocks are as white as snow  and long green silk ribands flutter\\r\\nfrom their bonnets  their brother  who is older than they are  stands up\\r\\nin the swing  he twines his arms round the cords to hold himself fast \\r\\nfor in one hand he has a little cup  and in the other a clay-pipe  he is\\r\\nblowing soap-bubbles  the swing moves  and the bubbles float in charming\\r\\nchanging colors: the last is still hanging to the end of the pipe  and\\r\\nrocks in the breeze  the swing moves  the little black dog  as light as\\r\\na soap-bubble  jumps up on his hind legs to try to get into the swing \\r\\nit moves  the dog falls down  barks  and is angry  they tease him  the\\r\\nbubble bursts  a swing  a bursting bubblesuch is my song ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“what you relate may be very pretty  but you tell it in so melancholy a\\r\\nmanner  and do not mention kay ”\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat do the hyacinths say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“there were once upon a time three sisters  quite transparent  and very\\r\\nbeautiful  the robe of the one was red  that of the second blue  and\\r\\nthat of the third white  they danced hand in hand beside the calm\\r\\nlake in the clear moonshine  they were not elfin maidens  but mortal\\r\\nchildren  a sweet fragrance was smelt  and the maidens vanished in the\\r\\nwood  the fragrance grew strongerthree coffins  and in them three\\r\\nlovely maidens  glided out of the forest and across the lake: the\\r\\nshining glow-worms flew around like little floating lights  do the\\r\\ndancing maidens sleep  or are they dead? the odour of the flowers says\\r\\nthey are corpses  the evening bell tolls for the dead ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“you make me quite sad ” said little gerda  “i cannot help thinking of\\r\\nthe dead maidens  oh  is little kay really dead? the roses have been in\\r\\nthe earth  and they say no ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“ding  dong ” sounded the hyacinth bells  “we do not toll for little\\r\\nkay  we do not know him  that is our way of singing  the only one we\\r\\nhave ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand gerda went to the ranunculuses  that looked forth from among the\\r\\nshining green leaves \\r\\n\\r\\n“you are a little bright sun ” said gerda  “tell me if you know where i\\r\\ncan find my playfellow ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the ranunculus shone brightly  and looked again at gerda  what\\r\\nsong could the ranunculus sing? it was one that said nothing about kay\\r\\neither \\r\\n\\r\\n“in a small court the bright sun was shining in the first days of\\r\\nspring  the beams glided down the white walls of a neighbor's house  and\\r\\nclose by the fresh yellow flowers were growing  shining like gold in\\r\\nthe warm sun-rays  an old grandmother was sitting in the air  her\\r\\ngrand-daughter  the poor and lovely servant just come for a short visit \\r\\nshe knows her grandmother  there was gold  pure virgin gold in that\\r\\nblessed kiss  there  that is my little story ” said the ranunculus \\r\\n\\r\\n“my poor old grandmother ” sighed gerda  “yes  she is longing for me \\r\\nno doubt: she is sorrowing for me  as she did for little kay  but i\\r\\nwill soon come home  and then i will bring kay with me  it is of no use\\r\\nasking the flowers  they only know their own old rhymes  and can tell me\\r\\nnothing ” and she tucked up her frock  to enable her to run quicker  but\\r\\nthe narcissus gave her a knock on the leg  just as she was going to\\r\\njump over it  so she stood still  looked at the long yellow flower  and\\r\\nasked  “you perhaps know something?” and she bent down to the narcissus \\r\\nand what did it say?\\r\\n\\r\\n“i can see myselfi can see myself  oh  how odorous i am  up in the\\r\\nlittle garret there stands  half-dressed  a little dancer  she stands\\r\\nnow on one leg  now on both  she despises the whole world  yet she lives\\r\\nonly in imagination  she pours water out of the teapot over a piece of\\r\\nstuff which she holds in her hand  it is the bodice  cleanliness is a\\r\\nfine thing  the white dress is hanging on the hook  it was washed in the\\r\\nteapot  and dried on the roof  she puts it on  ties a saffron-colored\\r\\nkerchief round her neck  and then the gown looks whiter  i can see\\r\\nmyselfi can see myself ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that's nothing to me ” said little gerda  “that does not concern me ”\\r\\n and then off she ran to the further end of the garden \\r\\n\\r\\nthe gate was locked  but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened \\r\\nand the gate opened  and little gerda ran off barefooted into the wide\\r\\nworld  she looked round her thrice  but no one followed her  at last she\\r\\ncould run no longer  she sat down on a large stone  and when she looked\\r\\nabout her  she saw that the summer had passed  it was late in the\\r\\nautumn  but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden  where\\r\\nthere was always sunshine  and where there were flowers the whole year\\r\\nround \\r\\n\\r\\n“dear me  how long i have staid ” said gerda  “autumn is come  i must\\r\\nnot rest any longer ” and she got up to go further \\r\\n\\r\\noh  how tender and wearied her little feet were  all around it looked\\r\\nso cold and raw: the long willow-leaves were quite yellow  and the fog\\r\\ndripped from them like water  one leaf fell after the other: the sloes\\r\\nonly stood full of fruit  which set one's teeth on edge  oh  how dark\\r\\nand comfortless it was in the dreary world \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfourth story  the prince and princess\\r\\n\\r\\ngerda was obliged to rest herself again  when  exactly opposite to her \\r\\na large raven came hopping over the white snow  he had long been looking\\r\\nat gerda and shaking his head  and now he said  “caw  caw ” good day \\r\\ngood day  he could not say it better  but he felt a sympathy for the\\r\\nlittle girl  and asked her where she was going all alone  the word\\r\\n“alone” gerda understood quite well  and felt how much was expressed\\r\\nby it  so she told the raven her whole history  and asked if he had not\\r\\nseen kay \\r\\n\\r\\nthe raven nodded very gravely  and said  “it may beit may be ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“what  do you really think so?” cried the little girl  and she nearly\\r\\nsqueezed the raven to death  so much did she kiss him \\r\\n\\r\\n“gently  gently ” said the raven  “i think i know  i think that it may\\r\\nbe little kay  but now he has forgotten you for the princess ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“does he live with a princess?” asked gerda \\r\\n\\r\\n“yeslisten ” said the raven  “but it will be difficult for me to\\r\\nspeak your language  if you understand the raven language i can tell you\\r\\nbetter ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“no  i have not learnt it ” said gerda  “but my grandmother understands\\r\\nit  and she can speak gibberish too  i wish i had learnt it ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“no matter ” said the raven  “i will tell you as well as i can  however \\r\\nit will be bad enough ” and then he told all he knew \\r\\n\\r\\n“in the kingdom where we now are there lives a princess  who is\\r\\nextraordinarily clever  for she has read all the newspapers in the whole\\r\\nworld  and has forgotten them againso clever is she  she was lately \\r\\nit is said  sitting on her thronewhich is not very amusing after\\r\\nallwhen she began humming an old tune  and it was just  'oh  why\\r\\nshould i not be married?' 'that song is not without its meaning ' said\\r\\nshe  and so then she was determined to marry  but she would have a\\r\\nhusband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken tonot\\r\\none who looked only as if he were a great personage  for that is so\\r\\ntiresome  she then had all the ladies of the court drummed together  and\\r\\nwhen they heard her intention  all were very pleased  and said  'we are\\r\\nvery glad to hear it  it is the very thing we were thinking of ' you may\\r\\nbelieve every word i say ” said the raven  “for i have a tame sweetheart\\r\\nthat hops about in the palace quite free  and it was she who told me all\\r\\nthis \\r\\n\\r\\n“the newspapers appeared forthwith with a border of hearts and the\\r\\ninitials of the princess  and therein you might read that every\\r\\ngood-looking young man was at liberty to come to the palace and speak to\\r\\nthe princess  and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt himself at\\r\\nhome there  that one the princess would choose for her husband \\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  yes ” said the raven  “you may believe it  it is as true as i am\\r\\nsitting here  people came in crowds  there was a crush and a hurry  but\\r\\nno one was successful either on the first or second day  they could all\\r\\ntalk well enough when they were out in the street  but as soon as\\r\\nthey came inside the palace gates  and saw the guard richly dressed\\r\\nin silver  and the lackeys in gold on the staircase  and the large\\r\\nilluminated saloons  then they were abashed  and when they stood before\\r\\nthe throne on which the princess was sitting  all they could do was\\r\\nto repeat the last word they had uttered  and to hear it again did not\\r\\ninterest her very much  it was just as if the people within were under\\r\\na charm  and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the\\r\\nstreet  for thenoh  thenthey could chatter enough  there was a whole\\r\\nrow of them standing from the town-gates to the palace  i was there\\r\\nmyself to look ” said the raven  “they grew hungry and thirsty  but from\\r\\nthe palace they got nothing whatever  not even a glass of water  some\\r\\nof the cleverest  it is true  had taken bread and butter with them:\\r\\nbut none shared it with his neighbor  for each thought  'let him look\\r\\nhungry  and then the princess won't have him '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“but kaylittle kay ” said gerda  “when did he come? was he among the\\r\\nnumber?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“patience  patience  we are just come to him  it was on the third day\\r\\nwhen a little personage without horse or equipage  came marching right\\r\\nboldly up to the palace  his eyes shone like yours  he had beautiful\\r\\nlong hair  but his clothes were very shabby ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that was kay ” cried gerda  with a voice of delight  “oh  now i've\\r\\nfound him ” and she clapped her hands for joy \\r\\n\\r\\n“he had a little knapsack at his back ” said the raven \\r\\n\\r\\n“no  that was certainly his sledge ” said gerda  “for when he went away\\r\\nhe took his sledge with him ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that may be ” said the raven  “i did not examine him so minutely  but\\r\\ni know from my tame sweetheart  that when he came into the court-yard\\r\\nof the palace  and saw the body-guard in silver  the lackeys on the\\r\\nstaircase  he was not the least abashed  he nodded  and said to them \\r\\n'it must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs  for my part  i shall\\r\\ngo in ' the saloons were gleaming with lustresprivy councillors and\\r\\nexcellencies were walking about barefooted  and wore gold keys  it was\\r\\nenough to make any one feel uncomfortable  his boots creaked  too  so\\r\\nloudly  but still he was not at all afraid ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that's kay for certain ” said gerda  “i know he had on new boots  i\\r\\nhave heard them creaking in grandmama's room ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  they creaked ” said the raven  “and on he went boldly up to the\\r\\nprincess  who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel \\r\\nall the ladies of the court  with their attendants and attendants'\\r\\nattendants  and all the cavaliers  with their gentlemen and gentlemen's\\r\\ngentlemen  stood round  and the nearer they stood to the door  the\\r\\nprouder they looked  it was hardly possible to look at the gentleman's\\r\\ngentleman  so very haughtily did he stand in the doorway ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“it must have been terrible ” said little gerda  “and did kay get the\\r\\nprincess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“were i not a raven  i should have taken the princess myself  although\\r\\ni am promised  it is said he spoke as well as i speak when i talk raven\\r\\nlanguage  this i learned from my tame sweetheart  he was bold and nicely\\r\\nbehaved  he had not come to woo the princess  but only to hear her\\r\\nwisdom  she pleased him  and he pleased her ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  yes  for certain that was kay ” said gerda  “he was so clever \\r\\nhe could reckon fractions in his head  oh  won't you take me to the\\r\\npalace?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that is very easily said ” answered the raven  “but how are we to\\r\\nmanage it? i'll speak to my tame sweetheart about it: she must advise\\r\\nus  for so much i must tell you  such a little girl as you are will\\r\\nnever get permission to enter ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  yes i shall ” said gerda  “when kay hears that i am here  he will\\r\\ncome out directly to fetch me ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“wait for me here on these steps ” said the raven  he moved his head\\r\\nbackwards and forwards and flew away \\r\\n\\r\\nthe evening was closing in when the raven returned  “cawcaw ” said he \\r\\n“she sends you her compliments  and here is a roll for you  she took\\r\\nit out of the kitchen  where there is bread enough  you are hungry \\r\\nno doubt  it is not possible for you to enter the palace  for you are\\r\\nbarefooted: the guards in silver  and the lackeys in gold  would not\\r\\nallow it  but do not cry  you shall come in still  my sweetheart knows a\\r\\nlittle back stair that leads to the bedchamber  and she knows where she\\r\\ncan get the key of it ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand they went into the garden in the large avenue  where one leaf was\\r\\nfalling after the other  and when the lights in the palace had all\\r\\ngradually disappeared  the raven led little gerda to the back door \\r\\nwhich stood half open \\r\\n\\r\\noh  how gerda's heart beat with anxiety and longing  it was just as if\\r\\nshe had been about to do something wrong  and yet she only wanted to\\r\\nknow if little kay was there  yes  he must be there  she called to mind\\r\\nhis intelligent eyes  and his long hair  so vividly  she could quite see\\r\\nhim as he used to laugh when they were sitting under the roses at home \\r\\n“he will  no doubt  be glad to see youto hear what a long way you have\\r\\ncome for his sake  to know how unhappy all at home were when he did not\\r\\ncome back ”\\r\\n\\r\\noh  what a fright and a joy it was \\r\\n\\r\\nthey were now on the stairs  a single lamp was burning there  and on the\\r\\nfloor stood the tame raven  turning her head on every side and looking\\r\\nat gerda  who bowed as her grandmother had taught her to do \\r\\n\\r\\n“my intended has told me so much good of you  my dear young lady ” said\\r\\nthe tame raven  “your tale is very affecting  if you will take the lamp \\r\\ni will go before  we will go straight on  for we shall meet no one ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i think there is somebody just behind us ” said gerda  and something\\r\\nrushed past: it was like shadowy figures on the wall  horses with\\r\\nflowing manes and thin legs  huntsmen  ladies and gentlemen on\\r\\nhorseback \\r\\n\\r\\n“they are only dreams ” said the raven  “they come to fetch the thoughts\\r\\nof the high personages to the chase  'tis well  for now you can observe\\r\\nthem in bed all the better  but let me find  when you enjoy honor and\\r\\ndistinction  that you possess a grateful heart ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“tut  that's not worth talking about ” said the raven of the woods \\r\\n\\r\\nthey now entered the first saloon  which was of rose-colored satin  with\\r\\nartificial flowers on the wall  here the dreams were rushing past \\r\\nbut they hastened by so quickly that gerda could not see the high\\r\\npersonages  one hall was more magnificent than the other  one might\\r\\nindeed well be abashed  and at last they came into the bedchamber  the\\r\\nceiling of the room resembled a large palm-tree with leaves of glass \\r\\nof costly glass  and in the middle  from a thick golden stem  hung two\\r\\nbeds  each of which resembled a lily  one was white  and in this lay the\\r\\nprincess  the other was red  and it was here that gerda was to look for\\r\\nlittle kay  she bent back one of the red leaves  and saw a brown neck \\r\\noh  that was kay  she called him quite loud by name  held the lamp\\r\\ntowards himthe dreams rushed back again into the chamberhe awoke \\r\\nturned his head  andit was not little kay \\r\\n\\r\\nthe prince was only like him about the neck  but he was young and\\r\\nhandsome  and out of the white lily leaves the princess peeped  too \\r\\nand asked what was the matter  then little gerda cried  and told her her\\r\\nwhole history  and all that the ravens had done for her \\r\\n\\r\\n“poor little thing ” said the prince and the princess  they praised the\\r\\nravens very much  and told them they were not at all angry with them \\r\\nbut they were not to do so again  however  they should have a reward \\r\\n“will you fly about here at liberty ” asked the princess  “or would you\\r\\nlike to have a fixed appointment as court ravens  with all the broken\\r\\nbits from the kitchen?”\\r\\n\\r\\nand both the ravens nodded  and begged for a fixed appointment  for\\r\\nthey thought of their old age  and said  “it is a good thing to have a\\r\\nprovision for our old days ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the prince got up and let gerda sleep in his bed  and more than this\\r\\nhe could not do  she folded her little hands and thought  “how good men\\r\\nand animals are ” and she then fell asleep and slept soundly  all the\\r\\ndreams flew in again  and they now looked like the angels  they drew\\r\\na little sledge  in which little kay sat and nodded his head  but the\\r\\nwhole was only a dream  and therefore it all vanished as soon as she\\r\\nawoke \\r\\n\\r\\nthe next day she was dressed from head to foot in silk and velvet  they\\r\\noffered to let her stay at the palace  and lead a happy life  but she\\r\\nbegged to have a little carriage with a horse in front  and for a small\\r\\npair of shoes  then  she said  she would again go forth in the wide\\r\\nworld and look for kay \\r\\n\\r\\nshoes and a muff were given her  she was  too  dressed very nicely  and\\r\\nwhen she was about to set off  a new carriage stopped before the door \\r\\nit was of pure gold  and the arms of the prince and princess shone\\r\\nlike a star upon it  the coachman  the footmen  and the outriders  for\\r\\noutriders were there  too  all wore golden crowns  the prince and the\\r\\nprincess assisted her into the carriage themselves  and wished her all\\r\\nsuccess  the raven of the woods  who was now married  accompanied her\\r\\nfor the first three miles  he sat beside gerda  for he could not bear\\r\\nriding backwards  the other raven stood in the doorway  and flapped her\\r\\nwings  she could not accompany gerda  because she suffered from headache\\r\\nsince she had had a fixed appointment and ate so much  the carriage\\r\\nwas lined inside with sugar-plums  and in the seats were fruits and\\r\\ngingerbread \\r\\n\\r\\n“farewell  farewell ” cried prince and princess  and gerda wept  and\\r\\nthe raven wept  thus passed the first miles  and then the raven bade her\\r\\nfarewell  and this was the most painful separation of all  he flew into\\r\\na tree  and beat his black wings as long as he could see the carriage \\r\\nthat shone from afar like a sunbeam \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfifth story  the little robber maiden\\r\\n\\r\\nthey drove through the dark wood  but the carriage shone like a torch \\r\\nand it dazzled the eyes of the robbers  so that they could not bear to\\r\\nlook at it \\r\\n\\r\\n“'tis gold  'tis gold ” they cried  and they rushed forward  seized\\r\\nthe horses  knocked down the little postilion  the coachman  and the\\r\\nservants  and pulled little gerda out of the carriage \\r\\n\\r\\n“how plump  how beautiful she is  she must have been fed on\\r\\nnut-kernels ” said the old female robber  who had a long  scrubby beard \\r\\nand bushy eyebrows that hung down over her eyes  “she is as good as a\\r\\nfatted lamb  how nice she will be ” and then she drew out a knife  the\\r\\nblade of which shone so that it was quite dreadful to behold \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh ” cried the woman at the same moment  she had been bitten in the ear\\r\\nby her own little daughter  who hung at her back  and who was so wild\\r\\nand unmanageable  that it was quite amusing to see her  “you naughty\\r\\nchild ” said the mother: and now she had not time to kill gerda \\r\\n\\r\\n“she shall play with me ” said the little robber child  “she shall give\\r\\nme her muff  and her pretty frock  she shall sleep in my bed ” and then\\r\\nshe gave her mother another bite  so that she jumped  and ran round with\\r\\nthe pain  and the robbers laughed  and said  “look  how she is dancing\\r\\nwith the little one ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i will go into the carriage ” said the little robber maiden  and she\\r\\nwould have her will  for she was very spoiled and very headstrong  she\\r\\nand gerda got in  and then away they drove over the stumps of felled\\r\\ntrees  deeper and deeper into the woods  the little robber maiden was as\\r\\ntall as gerda  but stronger  broader-shouldered  and of dark complexion \\r\\nher eyes were quite black  they looked almost melancholy  she embraced\\r\\nlittle gerda  and said  “they shall not kill you as long as i am not\\r\\ndispleased with you  you are  doubtless  a princess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“no ” said little gerda  who then related all that had happened to her \\r\\nand how much she cared about little kay \\r\\n\\r\\nthe little robber maiden looked at her with a serious air  nodded her\\r\\nhead slightly  and said  “they shall not kill you  even if i am angry\\r\\nwith you: then i will do it myself”  and she dried gerda's eyes  and put\\r\\nboth her hands in the handsome muff  which was so soft and warm \\r\\n\\r\\nat length the carriage stopped  they were in the midst of the court-yard\\r\\nof a robber's castle  it was full of cracks from top to bottom  and out\\r\\nof the openings magpies and rooks were flying  and the great bull-dogs \\r\\neach of which looked as if he could swallow a man  jumped up  but they\\r\\ndid not bark  for that was forbidden \\r\\n\\r\\nin the midst of the large  old  smoking hall burnt a great fire on the\\r\\nstone floor  the smoke disappeared under the stones  and had to seek\\r\\nits own egress  in an immense caldron soup was boiling  and rabbits and\\r\\nhares were being roasted on a spit \\r\\n\\r\\n“you shall sleep with me to-night  with all my animals ” said the little\\r\\nrobber maiden  they had something to eat and drink  and then went into\\r\\na corner  where straw and carpets were lying  beside them  on laths and\\r\\nperches  sat nearly a hundred pigeons  all asleep  seemingly  but yet\\r\\nthey moved a little when the robber maiden came  “they are all mine ”\\r\\n said she  at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs\\r\\nand shaking it so that its wings fluttered  “kiss it ” cried the little\\r\\ngirl  and flung the pigeon in gerda's face  “up there is the rabble of\\r\\nthe wood ” continued she  pointing to several laths which were fastened\\r\\nbefore a hole high up in the wall  “that's the rabble  they would all\\r\\nfly away immediately  if they were not well fastened in  and here is my\\r\\ndear old bac”  and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer  that had a\\r\\nbright copper ring round its neck  and was tethered to the spot  “we are\\r\\nobliged to lock this fellow in too  or he would make his escape  every\\r\\nevening i tickle his neck with my sharp knife  he is so frightened at\\r\\nit ” and the little girl drew forth a long knife  from a crack in the\\r\\nwall  and let it glide over the reindeer's neck  the poor animal kicked \\r\\nthe girl laughed  and pulled gerda into bed with her \\r\\n\\r\\n“do you intend to keep your knife while you sleep?” asked gerda  looking\\r\\nat it rather fearfully \\r\\n\\r\\n“i always sleep with the knife ” said the little robber maiden  “there\\r\\nis no knowing what may happen  but tell me now  once more  all about\\r\\nlittle kay  and why you have started off in the wide world alone ” and\\r\\ngerda related all  from the very beginning: the wood-pigeons cooed above\\r\\nin their cage  and the others slept  the little robber maiden wound her\\r\\narm round gerda's neck  held the knife in the other hand  and snored so\\r\\nloud that everybody could hear her  but gerda could not close her eyes \\r\\nfor she did not know whether she was to live or die  the robbers sat\\r\\nround the fire  sang and drank  and the old female robber jumped about\\r\\nso  that it was quite dreadful for gerda to see her \\r\\n\\r\\nthen the wood-pigeons said  “coo  coo  we have seen little kay  a white\\r\\nhen carries his sledge  he himself sat in the carriage of the snow\\r\\nqueen  who passed here  down just over the wood  as we lay in our nest \\r\\nshe blew upon us young ones  and all died except we two  coo  coo ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“what is that you say up there?” cried little gerda  “where did the snow\\r\\nqueen go to? do you know anything about it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“she is no doubt gone to lapland  for there is always snow and ice\\r\\nthere  only ask the reindeer  who is tethered there ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“ice and snow is there  there it is  glorious and beautiful ” said the\\r\\nreindeer  “one can spring about in the large shining valleys  the snow\\r\\nqueen has her summer-tent there  but her fixed abode is high up towards\\r\\nthe north pole  on the island called spitzbergen ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  kay  poor little kay ” sighed gerda \\r\\n\\r\\n“do you choose to be quiet?” said the robber maiden  “if you don't  i\\r\\nshall make you ”\\r\\n\\r\\nin the morning gerda told her all that the wood-pigeons had said  and\\r\\nthe little maiden looked very serious  but she nodded her head  and\\r\\nsaid  “that's no matterthat's no matter  do you know where lapland\\r\\nlies ” she asked of the reindeer \\r\\n\\r\\n“who should know better than i?” said the animal  and his eyes rolled in\\r\\nhis head  “i was born and bred therethere i leapt about on the fields\\r\\nof snow ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“listen ” said the robber maiden to gerda  “you see that the men are\\r\\ngone  but my mother is still here  and will remain  however  towards\\r\\nmorning she takes a draught out of the large flask  and then she sleeps\\r\\na little: then i will do something for you ” she now jumped out of bed \\r\\nflew to her mother  with her arms round her neck  and pulling her by the\\r\\nbeard  said  “good morrow  my own sweet nanny-goat of a mother ” and her\\r\\nmother took hold of her nose  and pinched it till it was red and blue \\r\\nbut this was all done out of pure love \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen the mother had taken a sup at her flask  and was having a nap  the\\r\\nlittle robber maiden went to the reindeer  and said  “i should very much\\r\\nlike to give you still many a tickling with the sharp knife  for then\\r\\nyou are so amusing  however  i will untether you  and help you out \\r\\nso that you may go back to lapland  but you must make good use of your\\r\\nlegs  and take this little girl for me to the palace of the snow queen \\r\\nwhere her playfellow is  you have heard  i suppose  all she said  for\\r\\nshe spoke loud enough  and you were listening ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe reindeer gave a bound for joy  the robber maiden lifted up little\\r\\ngerda  and took the precaution to bind her fast on the reindeer's back \\r\\nshe even gave her a small cushion to sit on  “here are your worsted\\r\\nleggins  for it will be cold  but the muff i shall keep for myself  for\\r\\nit is so very pretty  but i do not wish you to be cold  here is a pair\\r\\nof lined gloves of my mother's  they just reach up to your elbow  on\\r\\nwith them  now you look about the hands just like my ugly old mother ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand gerda wept for joy \\r\\n\\r\\n“i can't bear to see you fretting ” said the little robber maiden  “this\\r\\nis just the time when you ought to look pleased  here are two loaves and\\r\\na ham for you  so that you won't starve ” the bread and the meat were\\r\\nfastened to the reindeer's back  the little maiden opened the door \\r\\ncalled in all the dogs  and then with her knife cut the rope that\\r\\nfastened the animal  and said to him  “now  off with you  but take good\\r\\ncare of the little girl ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand gerda stretched out her hands with the large wadded gloves towards\\r\\nthe robber maiden  and said  “farewell ” and the reindeer flew on over\\r\\nbush and bramble through the great wood  over moor and heath  as fast as\\r\\nhe could go \\r\\n\\r\\n“ddsa  ddsa ” was heard in the sky  it was just as if somebody was\\r\\nsneezing \\r\\n\\r\\n“these are my old northern-lights ” said the reindeer  “look how they\\r\\ngleam ” and on he now sped still quickerday and night on he went: the\\r\\nloaves were consumed  and the ham too  and now they were in lapland \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsixth story  the lapland woman and the finland woman\\r\\n\\r\\nsuddenly they stopped before a little house  which looked very\\r\\nmiserable  the roof reached to the ground  and the door was so low  that\\r\\nthe family were obliged to creep upon their stomachs when they went in\\r\\nor out  nobody was at home except an old lapland woman  who was dressing\\r\\nfish by the light of an oil lamp  and the reindeer told her the whole\\r\\nof gerda's history  but first of all his own  for that seemed to him of\\r\\nmuch greater importance  gerda was so chilled that she could not speak \\r\\n\\r\\n“poor thing ” said the lapland woman  “you have far to run still  you\\r\\nhave more than a hundred miles to go before you get to finland  there\\r\\nthe snow queen has her country-house  and burns blue lights every\\r\\nevening  i will give you a few words from me  which i will write on a\\r\\ndried haberdine  for paper i have none  this you can take with you to\\r\\nthe finland woman  and she will be able to give you more information\\r\\nthan i can ”\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen gerda had warmed herself  and had eaten and drunk  the lapland\\r\\nwoman wrote a few words on a dried haberdine  begged gerda to take care\\r\\nof them  put her on the reindeer  bound her fast  and away sprang the\\r\\nanimal  “ddsa  ddsa ” was again heard in the air  the most charming\\r\\nblue lights burned the whole night in the sky  and at last they came to\\r\\nfinland  they knocked at the chimney of the finland woman  for as to a\\r\\ndoor  she had none \\r\\n\\r\\nthere was such a heat inside that the finland woman herself went about\\r\\nalmost naked  she was diminutive and dirty  she immediately loosened\\r\\nlittle gerda's clothes  pulled off her thick gloves and boots  for\\r\\notherwise the heat would have been too greatand after laying a piece\\r\\nof ice on the reindeer's head  read what was written on the fish-skin \\r\\nshe read it three times: she then knew it by heart  so she put the fish\\r\\ninto the cupboardfor it might very well be eaten  and she never threw\\r\\nanything away \\r\\n\\r\\nthen the reindeer related his own story first  and afterwards that of\\r\\nlittle gerda  and the finland woman winked her eyes  but said nothing \\r\\n\\r\\n“you are so clever ” said the reindeer  “you can  i know  twist all the\\r\\nwinds of the world together in a knot  if the seaman loosens one knot \\r\\nthen he has a good wind  if a second  then it blows pretty stiffly  if\\r\\nhe undoes the third and fourth  then it rages so that the forests are\\r\\nupturned  will you give the little maiden a potion  that she may possess\\r\\nthe strength of twelve men  and vanquish the snow queen?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“the strength of twelve men ” said the finland woman  “much good that\\r\\nwould be ” then she went to a cupboard  and drew out a large skin rolled\\r\\nup  when she had unrolled it  strange characters were to be seen written\\r\\nthereon  and the finland woman read at such a rate that the perspiration\\r\\ntrickled down her forehead \\r\\n\\r\\nbut the reindeer begged so hard for little gerda  and gerda looked so\\r\\nimploringly with tearful eyes at the finland woman  that she winked  and\\r\\ndrew the reindeer aside into a corner  where they whispered together \\r\\nwhile the animal got some fresh ice put on his head \\r\\n\\r\\n“'tis true little kay is at the snow queen's  and finds everything there\\r\\nquite to his taste  and he thinks it the very best place in the world \\r\\nbut the reason of that is  he has a splinter of glass in his eye  and in\\r\\nhis heart  these must be got out first  otherwise he will never go back\\r\\nto mankind  and the snow queen will retain her power over him ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“but can you give little gerda nothing to take which will endue her with\\r\\npower over the whole?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i can give her no more power than what she has already  don't you see\\r\\nhow great it is? don't you see how men and animals are forced to serve\\r\\nher  how well she gets through the world barefooted? she must not hear\\r\\nof her power from us  that power lies in her heart  because she is\\r\\na sweet and innocent child  if she cannot get to the snow queen by\\r\\nherself  and rid little kay of the glass  we cannot help her  two miles\\r\\nhence the garden of the snow queen begins  thither you may carry the\\r\\nlittle girl  set her down by the large bush with red berries  standing\\r\\nin the snow  don't stay talking  but hasten back as fast as possible ”\\r\\n and now the finland woman placed little gerda on the reindeer's back \\r\\nand off he ran with all imaginable speed \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  i have not got my boots  i have not brought my gloves ” cried\\r\\nlittle gerda  she remarked she was without them from the cutting frost \\r\\nbut the reindeer dared not stand still  on he ran till he came to the\\r\\ngreat bush with the red berries  and there he set gerda down  kissed her\\r\\nmouth  while large bright tears flowed from the animal's eyes  and then\\r\\nback he went as fast as possible  there stood poor gerda now  without\\r\\nshoes or gloves  in the very middle of dreadful icy finland \\r\\n\\r\\nshe ran on as fast as she could  there then came a whole regiment of\\r\\nsnow-flakes  but they did not fall from above  and they were quite\\r\\nbright and shining from the aurora borealis  the flakes ran along\\r\\nthe ground  and the nearer they came the larger they grew  gerda well\\r\\nremembered how large and strange the snow-flakes appeared when she\\r\\nonce saw them through a magnifying-glass  but now they were large and\\r\\nterrific in another mannerthey were all alive  they were the outposts\\r\\nof the snow queen  they had the most wondrous shapes  some looked like\\r\\nlarge ugly porcupines  others like snakes knotted together  with their\\r\\nheads sticking out  and others  again  like small fat bears  with the\\r\\nhair standing on end: all were of dazzling whitenessall were living\\r\\nsnow-flakes \\r\\n\\r\\nlittle gerda repeated the lord's prayer  the cold was so intense that\\r\\nshe could see her own breath  which came like smoke out of her mouth  it\\r\\ngrew thicker and thicker  and took the form of little angels  that grew\\r\\nmore and more when they touched the earth  all had helms on their heads \\r\\nand lances and shields in their hands  they increased in numbers  and\\r\\nwhen gerda had finished the lord's prayer  she was surrounded by a whole\\r\\nlegion  they thrust at the horrid snow-flakes with their spears  so that\\r\\nthey flew into a thousand pieces  and little gerda walked on bravely and\\r\\nin security  the angels patted her hands and feet  and then she felt the\\r\\ncold less  and went on quickly towards the palace of the snow queen \\r\\n\\r\\nbut now we shall see how kay fared  he never thought of gerda  and least\\r\\nof all that she was standing before the palace \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nseventh story  what took place in the palace of the snow queen  and what\\r\\nhappened afterward \\r\\n\\r\\nthe walls of the palace were of driving snow  and the windows and doors\\r\\nof cutting winds  there were more than a hundred halls there  according\\r\\nas the snow was driven by the winds  the largest was many miles in\\r\\nextent  all were lighted up by the powerful aurora borealis  and all\\r\\nwere so large  so empty  so icy cold  and so resplendent  mirth never\\r\\nreigned there  there was never even a little bear-ball  with the storm\\r\\nfor music  while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off\\r\\ntheir steps  never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes  vast \\r\\ncold  and empty were the halls of the snow queen  the northern-lights\\r\\nshone with such precision that one could tell exactly when they were\\r\\nat their highest or lowest degree of brightness  in the middle of the\\r\\nempty  endless hall of snow  was a frozen lake  it was cracked in a\\r\\nthousand pieces  but each piece was so like the other  that it seemed\\r\\nthe work of a cunning artificer  in the middle of this lake sat the snow\\r\\nqueen when she was at home  and then she said she was sitting in the\\r\\nmirror of understanding  and that this was the only one and the best\\r\\nthing in the world \\r\\n\\r\\nlittle kay was quite blue  yes nearly black with cold  but he did not\\r\\nobserve it  for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body \\r\\nand his heart was a lump of ice  he was dragging along some pointed\\r\\nflat pieces of ice  which he laid together in all possible ways  for he\\r\\nwanted to make something with them  just as we have little flat pieces\\r\\nof wood to make geometrical figures with  called the chinese puzzle \\r\\nkay made all sorts of figures  the most complicated  for it was\\r\\nan ice-puzzle for the understanding  in his eyes the figures were\\r\\nextraordinarily beautiful  and of the utmost importance  for the bit\\r\\nof glass which was in his eye caused this  he found whole figures which\\r\\nrepresented a written word  but he never could manage to represent just\\r\\nthe word he wantedthat word was “eternity”  and the snow queen had\\r\\nsaid  “if you can discover that figure  you shall be your own master \\r\\nand i will make you a present of the whole world and a pair of new\\r\\nskates ” but he could not find it out \\r\\n\\r\\n“i am going now to warm lands ” said the snow queen  “i must have a look\\r\\ndown into the black caldrons ” it was the volcanoes vesuvius and etna\\r\\nthat she meant  “i will just give them a coating of white  for that is\\r\\nas it ought to be  besides  it is good for the oranges and the grapes ”\\r\\n and then away she flew  and kay sat quite alone in the empty halls of\\r\\nice that were miles long  and looked at the blocks of ice  and thought\\r\\nand thought till his skull was almost cracked  there he sat quite\\r\\nbenumbed and motionless  one would have imagined he was frozen to death \\r\\n\\r\\nsuddenly little gerda stepped through the great portal into the palace \\r\\nthe gate was formed of cutting winds  but gerda repeated her evening\\r\\nprayer  and the winds were laid as though they slept  and the little\\r\\nmaiden entered the vast  empty  cold halls  there she beheld kay: she\\r\\nrecognised him  flew to embrace him  and cried out  her arms firmly\\r\\nholding him the while  “kay  sweet little kay  have i then found you at\\r\\nlast?”\\r\\n\\r\\nbut he sat quite still  benumbed and cold  then little gerda shed\\r\\nburning tears  and they fell on his bosom  they penetrated to his\\r\\nheart  they thawed the lumps of ice  and consumed the splinters of the\\r\\nlooking-glass  he looked at her  and she sang the hymn:\\r\\n\\r\\n“the rose in the valley is blooming so sweet  and angels descend there\\r\\nthe children to greet ”\\r\\n\\r\\nhereupon kay burst into tears  he wept so much that the splinter rolled\\r\\nout of his eye  and he recognised her  and shouted  “gerda  sweet little\\r\\ngerda  where have you been so long? and where have i been?” he looked\\r\\nround him  “how cold it is here ” said he  “how empty and cold ” and he\\r\\nheld fast by gerda  who laughed and wept for joy  it was so beautiful \\r\\nthat even the blocks of ice danced about for joy  and when they were\\r\\ntired and laid themselves down  they formed exactly the letters which\\r\\nthe snow queen had told him to find out  so now he was his own master \\r\\nand he would have the whole world and a pair of new skates into the\\r\\nbargain \\r\\n\\r\\ngerda kissed his cheeks  and they grew quite blooming  she kissed his\\r\\neyes  and they shone like her own  she kissed his hands and feet  and he\\r\\nwas again well and merry  the snow queen might come back as soon as she\\r\\nliked  there stood his discharge written in resplendent masses of ice \\r\\n\\r\\nthey took each other by the hand  and wandered forth out of the large\\r\\nhall  they talked of their old grandmother  and of the roses upon the\\r\\nroof  and wherever they went  the winds ceased raging  and the sun burst\\r\\nforth  and when they reached the bush with the red berries  they found\\r\\nthe reindeer waiting for them  he had brought another  a young one  with\\r\\nhim  whose udder was filled with milk  which he gave to the little ones \\r\\nand kissed their lips  they then carried kay and gerdafirst to the\\r\\nfinland woman  where they warmed themselves in the warm room  and\\r\\nlearned what they were to do on their journey home  and they went to\\r\\nthe lapland woman  who made some new clothes for them and repaired their\\r\\nsledges \\r\\n\\r\\nthe reindeer and the young hind leaped along beside them  and\\r\\naccompanied them to the boundary of the country  here the first\\r\\nvegetation peeped forth  here kay and gerda took leave of the lapland\\r\\nwoman  “farewell  farewell ” they all said  and the first green buds\\r\\nappeared  the first little birds began to chirrup  and out of the wood\\r\\ncame  riding on a magnificent horse  which gerda knew (it was one of the\\r\\nleaders in the golden carriage)  a young damsel with a bright-red cap on\\r\\nher head  and armed with pistols  it was the little robber maiden  who \\r\\ntired of being at home  had determined to make a journey to the north \\r\\nand afterwards in another direction  if that did not please her  she\\r\\nrecognised gerda immediately  and gerda knew her too  it was a joyful\\r\\nmeeting \\r\\n\\r\\n“you are a fine fellow for tramping about ” said she to little kay  “i\\r\\nshould like to know  faith  if you deserve that one should run from one\\r\\nend of the world to the other for your sake?”\\r\\n\\r\\nbut gerda patted her cheeks  and inquired for the prince and princess \\r\\n\\r\\n“they are gone abroad ” said the other \\r\\n\\r\\n“but the raven?” asked little gerda \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  the raven is dead ” she answered  “his tame sweetheart is a\\r\\nwidow  and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg  she laments most\\r\\npiteously  but it's all mere talk and stuff  now tell me what you've\\r\\nbeen doing and how you managed to catch him ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand gerda and kay both told their story \\r\\n\\r\\nand “schnipp-schnapp-schnurre-basselurre ” said the robber maiden  and\\r\\nshe took the hands of each  and promised that if she should some day\\r\\npass through the town where they lived  she would come and visit them \\r\\nand then away she rode  kay and gerda took each other's hand: it was\\r\\nlovely spring weather  with abundance of flowers and of verdure  the\\r\\nchurch-bells rang  and the children recognised the high towers  and the\\r\\nlarge town  it was that in which they dwelt  they entered and hastened\\r\\nup to their grandmother's room  where everything was standing as\\r\\nformerly  the clock said “tick  tack ” and the finger moved round  but\\r\\nas they entered  they remarked that they were now grown up  the roses\\r\\non the leads hung blooming in at the open window  there stood the little\\r\\nchildren's chairs  and kay and gerda sat down on them  holding each\\r\\nother by the hand  they both had forgotten the cold empty splendor of\\r\\nthe snow queen  as though it had been a dream  the grandmother sat in\\r\\nthe bright sunshine  and read aloud from the bible: “unless ye become as\\r\\nlittle children  ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand kay and gerda looked in each other's eyes  and all at once they\\r\\nunderstood the old hymn:\\r\\n\\r\\n“the rose in the valley is blooming so sweet  and angels descend there\\r\\nthe children to greet ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthere sat the two grown-up persons  grown-up  and yet children  children\\r\\nat least in heart  and it was summer-time  summer  glorious summer \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe leap-frog\\r\\n\\r\\na flea  a grasshopper  and a leap-frog once wanted to see which could\\r\\njump highest  and they invited the whole world  and everybody else\\r\\nbesides who chose to come to see the festival  three famous jumpers were\\r\\nthey  as everyone would say  when they all met together in the room \\r\\n\\r\\n“i will give my daughter to him who jumps highest ” exclaimed the king \\r\\n“for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump for ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe flea was the first to step forward  he had exquisite manners  and\\r\\nbowed to the company on all sides  for he had noble blood  and was \\r\\nmoreover  accustomed to the society of man alone  and that makes a great\\r\\ndifference \\r\\n\\r\\nthen came the grasshopper  he was considerably heavier  but he was\\r\\nwell-mannered  and wore a green uniform  which he had by right of birth \\r\\nhe said  moreover  that he belonged to a very ancient egyptian family \\r\\nand that in the house where he then was  he was thought much of  the\\r\\nfact was  he had been just brought out of the fields  and put in a\\r\\npasteboard house  three stories high  all made of court-cards  with the\\r\\ncolored side inwards  and doors and windows cut out of the body of\\r\\nthe queen of hearts  “i sing so well ” said he  “that sixteen native\\r\\ngrasshoppers who have chirped from infancy  and yet got no house built\\r\\nof cards to live in  grew thinner than they were before for sheer\\r\\nvexation when they heard me ”\\r\\n\\r\\nit was thus that the flea and the grasshopper gave an account of\\r\\nthemselves  and thought they were quite good enough to marry a princess \\r\\n\\r\\nthe leap-frog said nothing  but people gave it as their opinion  that\\r\\nhe therefore thought the more  and when the housedog snuffed at him\\r\\nwith his nose  he confessed the leap-frog was of good family  the old\\r\\ncouncillor  who had had three orders given him to make him hold his\\r\\ntongue  asserted that the leap-frog was a prophet  for that one could\\r\\nsee on his back  if there would be a severe or mild winter  and that\\r\\nwas what one could not see even on the back of the man who writes the\\r\\nalmanac \\r\\n\\r\\n“i say nothing  it is true ” exclaimed the king  “but i have my own\\r\\nopinion  notwithstanding ”\\r\\n\\r\\nnow the trial was to take place  the flea jumped so high that nobody\\r\\ncould see where he went to  so they all asserted he had not jumped at\\r\\nall  and that was dishonorable \\r\\n\\r\\nthe grasshopper jumped only half as high  but he leaped into the king's\\r\\nface  who said that was ill-mannered \\r\\n\\r\\nthe leap-frog stood still for a long time lost in thought  it was\\r\\nbelieved at last he would not jump at all \\r\\n\\r\\n“i only hope he is not unwell ” said the house-dog  when  pop  he made a\\r\\njump all on one side into the lap of the princess  who was sitting on a\\r\\nlittle golden stool close by \\r\\n\\r\\nhereupon the king said  “there is nothing above my daughter  therefore\\r\\nto bound up to her is the highest jump that can be made  but for this \\r\\none must possess understanding  and the leap-frog has shown that he has\\r\\nunderstanding  he is brave and intellectual ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand so he won the princess \\r\\n\\r\\n“it's all the same to me ” said the flea  “she may have the old\\r\\nleap-frog  for all i care  i jumped the highest  but in this world\\r\\nmerit seldom meets its reward  a fine exterior is what people look at\\r\\nnow-a-days ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe flea then went into foreign service  where  it is said  he was\\r\\nkilled \\r\\n\\r\\nthe grasshopper sat without on a green bank  and reflected on worldly\\r\\nthings  and he said too  “yes  a fine exterior is everythinga fine\\r\\nexterior is what people care about ” and then he began chirping his\\r\\npeculiar melancholy song  from which we have taken this history  and\\r\\nwhich may  very possibly  be all untrue  although it does stand here\\r\\nprinted in black and white \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe elderbush\\r\\n\\r\\nonce upon a time there was a little boy who had taken cold  he had\\r\\ngone out and got his feet wet  though nobody could imagine how it had\\r\\nhappened  for it was quite dry weather  so his mother undressed him  put\\r\\nhim to bed  and had the tea-pot brought in  to make him a good cup of\\r\\nelderflower tea  just at that moment the merry old man came in who\\r\\nlived up a-top of the house all alone  for he had neither wife nor\\r\\nchildrenbut he liked children very much  and knew so many fairy tales \\r\\nthat it was quite delightful \\r\\n\\r\\n“now drink your tea ” said the boy's mother  “then  perhaps  you may\\r\\nhear a fairy tale ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“if i had but something new to tell ” said the old man  “but how did the\\r\\nchild get his feet wet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that is the very thing that nobody can make out ” said his mother \\r\\n\\r\\n“am i to hear a fairy tale?” asked the little boy \\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  if you can tell me exactlyfor i must know that firsthow deep\\r\\nthe gutter is in the little street opposite  that you pass through in\\r\\ngoing to school ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“just up to the middle of my boot ” said the child  “but then i must go\\r\\ninto the deep hole ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“ah  ah  that's where the wet feet came from ” said the old man  “i\\r\\nought now to tell you a story  but i don't know any more ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“you can make one in a moment ” said the little boy  “my mother says\\r\\nthat all you look at can be turned into a fairy tale: and that you can\\r\\nfind a story in everything ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  but such tales and stories are good for nothing  the right sort\\r\\ncome of themselves  they tap at my forehead and say  'here we are '”\\r\\n\\r\\n“won't there be a tap soon?” asked the little boy  and his mother\\r\\nlaughed  put some elder-flowers in the tea-pot  and poured boiling water\\r\\nupon them \\r\\n\\r\\n“do tell me something  pray do ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  if a fairy tale would come of its own accord  but they are proud\\r\\nand haughty  and come only when they choose  stop ” said he  all on a\\r\\nsudden  “i have it  pay attention  there is one in the tea-pot ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the little boy looked at the tea-pot  the cover rose more and more \\r\\nand the elder-flowers came forth so fresh and white  and shot up long\\r\\nbranches  out of the spout even did they spread themselves on all sides \\r\\nand grew larger and larger  it was a splendid elderbush  a whole tree \\r\\nand it reached into the very bed  and pushed the curtains aside  how\\r\\nit bloomed  and what an odour  in the middle of the bush sat a\\r\\nfriendly-looking old woman in a most strange dress  it was quite\\r\\ngreen  like the leaves of the elder  and was trimmed with large white\\r\\nelder-flowers  so that at first one could not tell whether it was a\\r\\nstuff  or a natural green and real flowers \\r\\n\\r\\n“what's that woman's name?” asked the little boy \\r\\n\\r\\n“the greeks and romans ” said the old man  “called her a dryad  but that\\r\\nwe do not understand  the people who live in the new booths [*] have a much\\r\\nbetter name for her  they call her 'old granny'and she it is to\\r\\nwhom you are to pay attention  now listen  and look at the beautiful\\r\\nelderbush \\r\\n\\r\\n     * a row of buildings for seamen in copenhagen \\r\\n\\r\\n“just such another large blooming elder tree stands near the new booths \\r\\nit grew there in the corner of a little miserable court-yard  and under\\r\\nit sat  of an afternoon  in the most splendid sunshine  two old\\r\\npeople  an old  old seaman  and his old  old wife  they had\\r\\ngreat-grand-children  and were soon to celebrate the fiftieth\\r\\nanniversary of their marriage  but they could not exactly recollect the\\r\\ndate: and old granny sat in the tree  and looked as pleased as now  'i\\r\\nknow the date ' said she  but those below did not hear her  for they\\r\\nwere talking about old times \\r\\n\\r\\n“'yes  can't you remember when we were very little ' said the old\\r\\nseaman  'and ran and played about? it was the very same court-yard where\\r\\nwe now are  and we stuck slips in the ground  and made a garden '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'i remember it well ' said the old woman  'i remember it quite well  we\\r\\nwatered the slips  and one of them was an elderbush  it took root  put\\r\\nforth green shoots  and grew up to be the large tree under which we old\\r\\nfolks are now sitting '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'to be sure ' said he  'and there in the corner stood a waterpail \\r\\nwhere i used to swim my boats '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'true  but first we went to school to learn somewhat ' said she  'and\\r\\nthen we were confirmed  we both cried  but in the afternoon we went up\\r\\nthe round tower  and looked down on copenhagen  and far  far away over\\r\\nthe water  then we went to friedericksberg  where the king and the queen\\r\\nwere sailing about in their splendid barges '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'but i had a different sort of sailing to that  later  and that  too \\r\\nfor many a year  a long way off  on great voyages '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'yes  many a time have i wept for your sake ' said she  'i thought you\\r\\nwere dead and gone  and lying down in the deep waters  many a night have\\r\\ni got up to see if the wind had not changed: and changed it had  sure\\r\\nenough  but you never came  i remember so well one day  when the rain\\r\\nwas pouring down in torrents  the scavengers were before the house where\\r\\ni was in service  and i had come up with the dust  and remained standing\\r\\nat the doorit was dreadful weatherwhen just as i was there  the\\r\\npostman came and gave me a letter  it was from you  what a tour that\\r\\nletter had made  i opened it instantly and read: i laughed and wept \\r\\ni was so happy  in it i read that you were in warm lands where the\\r\\ncoffee-tree grows  what a blessed land that must be  you related so\\r\\nmuch  and i saw it all the while the rain was pouring down  and i\\r\\nstanding there with the dust-box  at the same moment came someone who\\r\\nembraced me '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'yes  but you gave him a good box on his ear that made it tingle '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'but i did not know it was you  you arrived as soon as your letter \\r\\nand you were so handsomethat you still areand had a long yellow silk\\r\\nhandkerchief round your neck  and a bran new hat on  oh  you were so\\r\\ndashing  good heavens  what weather it was  and what a state the street\\r\\nwas in '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'and then we married ' said he  'don't you remember? and then we\\r\\nhad our first little boy  and then mary  and nicholas  and peter  and\\r\\nchristian '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'yes  and how they all grew up to be honest people  and were beloved by\\r\\neverybody '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'and their children also have children ' said the old sailor  'yes \\r\\nthose are our grand-children  full of strength and vigor  it was \\r\\nmethinks about this season that we had our wedding '\\r\\n\\r\\n“'yes  this very day is the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage ' said\\r\\nold granny  sticking her head between the two old people  who thought\\r\\nit was their neighbor who nodded to them  they looked at each other and\\r\\nheld one another by the hand  soon after came their children  and their\\r\\ngrand-children  for they knew well enough that it was the day of the\\r\\nfiftieth anniversary  and had come with their gratulations that very\\r\\nmorning  but the old people had forgotten it  although they were able\\r\\nto remember all that had happened many years ago  and the elderbush sent\\r\\nforth a strong odour in the sun  that was just about to set  and shone\\r\\nright in the old people's faces  they both looked so rosy-cheeked  and\\r\\nthe youngest of the grandchildren danced around them  and called out\\r\\nquite delighted  that there was to be something very splendid that\\r\\neveningthey were all to have hot potatoes  and old nanny nodded in the\\r\\nbush  and shouted 'hurrah ' with the rest ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“but that is no fairy tale ” said the little boy  who was listening to\\r\\nthe story \\r\\n\\r\\n“the thing is  you must understand it ” said the narrator  “let us ask\\r\\nold nanny ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that was no fairy tale  'tis true ” said old nanny  “but now it's\\r\\ncoming  the most wonderful fairy tales grow out of that which is\\r\\nreality  were that not the case  you know  my magnificent elderbush\\r\\ncould not have grown out of the tea-pot ” and then she took the little\\r\\nboy out of bed  laid him on her bosom  and the branches of the elder\\r\\ntree  full of flowers  closed around her  they sat in an aerial\\r\\ndwelling  and it flew with them through the air  oh  it was wondrous\\r\\nbeautiful  old nanny had grown all of a sudden a young and pretty\\r\\nmaiden  but her robe was still the same green stuff with white flowers \\r\\nwhich she had worn before  on her bosom she had a real elderflower \\r\\nand in her yellow waving hair a wreath of the flowers  her eyes were so\\r\\nlarge and blue that it was a pleasure to look at them  she kissed the\\r\\nboy  and now they were of the same age and felt alike \\r\\n\\r\\nhand in hand they went out of the bower  and they were standing in the\\r\\nbeautiful garden of their home  near the green lawn papa's walking-stick\\r\\nwas tied  and for the little ones it seemed to be endowed with life  for\\r\\nas soon as they got astride it  the round polished knob was turned into\\r\\na magnificent neighing head  a long black mane fluttered in the breeze \\r\\nand four slender yet strong legs shot out  the animal was strong and\\r\\nhandsome  and away they went at full gallop round the lawn \\r\\n\\r\\n“huzza  now we are riding miles off ” said the boy  “we are riding away\\r\\nto the castle where we were last year ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand on they rode round the grass-plot  and the little maiden  who  we\\r\\nknow  was no one else but old nanny  kept on crying out  “now we are in\\r\\nthe country  don't you see the farm-house yonder? and there is an elder\\r\\ntree standing beside it  and the cock is scraping away the earth for the\\r\\nhens  look  how he struts  and now we are close to the church  it lies\\r\\nhigh upon the hill  between the large oak-trees  one of which is half\\r\\ndecayed  and now we are by the smithy  where the fire is blazing  and\\r\\nwhere the half-naked men are banging with their hammers till the sparks\\r\\nfly about  away  away  to the beautiful country-seat ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand all that the little maiden  who sat behind on the stick  spoke of \\r\\nflew by in reality  the boy saw it all  and yet they were only going\\r\\nround the grass-plot  then they played in a side avenue  and marked out\\r\\na little garden on the earth  and they took elder-blossoms from their\\r\\nhair  planted them  and they grew just like those the old people planted\\r\\nwhen they were children  as related before  they went hand in hand  as\\r\\nthe old people had done when they were children  but not to the round\\r\\ntower  or to friedericksberg  no  the little damsel wound her arms round\\r\\nthe boy  and then they flew far away through all denmark  and spring\\r\\ncame  and summer  and then it was autumn  and then winter  and a\\r\\nthousand pictures were reflected in the eye and in the heart of the boy \\r\\nand the little girl always sang to him  “this you will never forget ”\\r\\n and during their whole flight the elder tree smelt so sweet and odorous \\r\\nhe remarked the roses and the fresh beeches  but the elder tree had\\r\\na more wondrous fragrance  for its flowers hung on the breast of the\\r\\nlittle maiden  and there  too  did he often lay his head during the\\r\\nflight \\r\\n\\r\\n“it is lovely here in spring ” said the young maiden  and they stood in\\r\\na beech-wood that had just put on its first green  where the woodroof [*]\\r\\nat their feet sent forth its fragrance  and the pale-red anemony looked\\r\\nso pretty among the verdure  “oh  would it were always spring in the\\r\\nsweetly-smelling danish beech-forests ”\\r\\n\\r\\n     * asperula odorata \\r\\n\\r\\n“it is lovely here in summer ” said she  and she flew past old castles\\r\\nof by-gone days of chivalry  where the red walls and the embattled\\r\\ngables were mirrored in the canal  where the swans were swimming  and\\r\\npeered up into the old cool avenues  in the fields the corn was waving\\r\\nlike the sea  in the ditches red and yellow flowers were growing  while\\r\\nwild-drone flowers  and blooming convolvuluses were creeping in the\\r\\nhedges  and towards evening the moon rose round and large  and the\\r\\nhaycocks in the meadows smelt so sweetly  “this one never forgets ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“it is lovely here in autumn ” said the little maiden  and suddenly the\\r\\natmosphere grew as blue again as before  the forest grew red  and green \\r\\nand yellow-colored  the dogs came leaping along  and whole flocks of\\r\\nwild-fowl flew over the cairn  where blackberry-bushes were hanging\\r\\nround the old stones  the sea was dark blue  covered with ships full\\r\\nof white sails  and in the barn old women  maidens  and children were\\r\\nsitting picking hops into a large cask  the young sang songs  but the\\r\\nold told fairy tales of mountain-sprites and soothsayers  nothing could\\r\\nbe more charming \\r\\n\\r\\n“it is delightful here in winter ” said the little maiden  and all the\\r\\ntrees were covered with hoar-frost  they looked like white corals  the\\r\\nsnow crackled under foot  as if one had new boots on  and one falling\\r\\nstar after the other was seen in the sky  the christmas-tree was lighted\\r\\nin the room  presents were there  and good-humor reigned  in the country\\r\\nthe violin sounded in the room of the peasant  the newly-baked cakes\\r\\nwere attacked  even the poorest child said  “it is really delightful\\r\\nhere in winter ”\\r\\n\\r\\nyes  it was delightful  and the little maiden showed the boy everything \\r\\nand the elder tree still was fragrant  and the red flag  with the white\\r\\ncross  was still waving: the flag under which the old seaman in the new\\r\\nbooths had sailed  and the boy grew up to be a lad  and was to go forth\\r\\nin the wide world-far  far away to warm lands  where the coffee-tree\\r\\ngrows  but at his departure the little maiden took an elder-blossom from\\r\\nher bosom  and gave it him to keep  and it was placed between the leaves\\r\\nof his prayer-book  and when in foreign lands he opened the book  it\\r\\nwas always at the place where the keepsake-flower lay  and the more he\\r\\nlooked at it  the fresher it became  he felt as it were  the fragrance\\r\\nof the danish groves  and from among the leaves of the flowers he could\\r\\ndistinctly see the little maiden  peeping forth with her bright blue\\r\\neyesand then she whispered  “it is delightful here in spring  summer \\r\\nautumn  and winter”  and a hundred visions glided before his mind \\r\\n\\r\\nthus passed many years  and he was now an old man  and sat with his old\\r\\nwife under the blooming tree  they held each other by the hand  as the\\r\\nold grand-father and grand-mother yonder in the new booths did  and they\\r\\ntalked exactly like them of old times  and of the fiftieth anniversary\\r\\nof their wedding  the little maiden  with the blue eyes  and with\\r\\nelder-blossoms in her hair  sat in the tree  nodded to both of them \\r\\nand said  “to-day is the fiftieth anniversary ” and then she took two\\r\\nflowers out of her hair  and kissed them  first  they shone like silver \\r\\nthen like gold  and when they laid them on the heads of the old people \\r\\neach flower became a golden crown  so there they both sat  like a king\\r\\nand a queen  under the fragrant tree  that looked exactly like an elder:\\r\\nthe old man told his wife the story of “old nanny ” as it had been told\\r\\nhim when a boy  and it seemed to both of them it contained much that\\r\\nresembled their own history  and those parts that were like it pleased\\r\\nthem best \\r\\n\\r\\n“thus it is ” said the little maiden in the tree  “some call me 'old\\r\\nnanny ' others a 'dryad ' but  in reality  my name is 'remembrance' \\r\\n'tis i who sit in the tree that grows and grows  i can remember  i can\\r\\ntell things  let me see if you have my flower still?”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the old man opened his prayer-book  there lay the elder-blossom \\r\\nas fresh as if it had been placed there but a short time before  and\\r\\nremembrance nodded  and the old people  decked with crowns of gold  sat\\r\\nin the flush of the evening sun  they closed their eyes  andand \\r\\nyes  that's the end of the story \\r\\n\\r\\nthe little boy lay in his bed  he did not know if he had dreamed or\\r\\nnot  or if he had been listening while someone told him the story  the\\r\\ntea-pot was standing on the table  but no elder tree was growing out\\r\\nof it  and the old man  who had been talking  was just on the point of\\r\\ngoing out at the door  and he did go \\r\\n\\r\\n“how splendid that was ” said the little boy  “mother  i have been to\\r\\nwarm countries ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“so i should think ” said his mother  “when one has drunk two good\\r\\ncupfuls of elder-flower tea  'tis likely enough one goes into warm\\r\\nclimates”  and she tucked him up nicely  least he should take cold  “you\\r\\nhave had a good sleep while i have been sitting here  and arguing with\\r\\nhim whether it was a story or a fairy tale ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“and where is old nanny?” asked the little boy \\r\\n\\r\\n“in the tea-pot ” said his mother  “and there she may remain ”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bell\\r\\n\\r\\npeople said “the evening bell is sounding  the sun is setting ” for a\\r\\nstrange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town \\r\\nit was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a\\r\\nmoment  for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude\\r\\nmade too great a noise \\r\\n\\r\\nthose persons who were walking outside the town  where the houses were\\r\\nfarther apart  with gardens or little fields between them  could see\\r\\nthe evening sky still better  and heard the sound of the bell much\\r\\nmore distinctly  it was as if the tones came from a church in the still\\r\\nforest  people looked thitherward  and felt their minds attuned most\\r\\nsolemnly \\r\\n\\r\\na long time passed  and people said to each other“i wonder if there\\r\\nis a church out in the wood? the bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet \\r\\nlet us stroll thither  and examine the matter nearer ” and the rich\\r\\npeople drove out  and the poor walked  but the way seemed strangely\\r\\nlong to them  and when they came to a clump of willows which grew on the\\r\\nskirts of the forest  they sat down  and looked up at the long\\r\\nbranches  and fancied they were now in the depth of the green wood  the\\r\\nconfectioner of the town came out  and set up his booth there  and soon\\r\\nafter came another confectioner  who hung a bell over his stand  as\\r\\na sign or ornament  but it had no clapper  and it was tarred over to\\r\\npreserve it from the rain  when all the people returned home  they said\\r\\nit had been very romantic  and that it was quite a different sort of\\r\\nthing to a pic-nic or tea-party  there were three persons who asserted\\r\\nthey had penetrated to the end of the forest  and that they had always\\r\\nheard the wonderful sounds of the bell  but it had seemed to them as if\\r\\nit had come from the town  one wrote a whole poem about it  and said the\\r\\nbell sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child  and\\r\\nthat no melody was sweeter than the tones of the bell  the king of the\\r\\ncountry was also observant of it  and vowed that he who could discover\\r\\nwhence the sounds proceeded  should have the title of “universal\\r\\nbell-ringer ” even if it were not really a bell \\r\\n\\r\\nmany persons now went to the wood  for the sake of getting the place \\r\\nbut one only returned with a sort of explanation  for nobody went far\\r\\nenough  that one not further than the others  however  he said that\\r\\nthe sound proceeded from a very large owl  in a hollow tree  a sort of\\r\\nlearned owl  that continually knocked its head against the branches  but\\r\\nwhether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree  that no\\r\\none could say with certainty  so now he got the place of “universal\\r\\nbell-ringer ” and wrote yearly a short treatise “on the owl”  but\\r\\neverybody was just as wise as before \\r\\n\\r\\nit was the day of confirmation  the clergyman had spoken so touchingly \\r\\nthe children who were confirmed had been greatly moved  it was\\r\\nan eventful day for them  from children they become all at once\\r\\ngrown-up-persons  it was as if their infant souls were now to fly all\\r\\nat once into persons with more understanding  the sun was shining\\r\\ngloriously  the children that had been confirmed went out of the town \\r\\nand from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell\\r\\nwith wonderful distinctness  they all immediately felt a wish to go\\r\\nthither  all except three  one of them had to go home to try on a\\r\\nball-dress  for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her\\r\\nto be confirmed this time  for otherwise she would not have come \\r\\nthe other was a poor boy  who had borrowed his coat and boots to be\\r\\nconfirmed in from the innkeeper's son  and he was to give them back by\\r\\na certain hour  the third said that he never went to a strange place\\r\\nif his parents were not with himthat he had always been a good boy\\r\\nhitherto  and would still be so now that he was confirmed  and that one\\r\\nought not to laugh at him for it: the others  however  did make fun of\\r\\nhim  after all \\r\\n\\r\\nthere were three  therefore  that did not go  the others hastened on \\r\\nthe sun shone  the birds sang  and the children sang too  and each held\\r\\nthe other by the hand  for as yet they had none of them any high office \\r\\nand were all of equal rank in the eye of god \\r\\n\\r\\nbut two of the youngest soon grew tired  and both returned to town  two\\r\\nlittle girls sat down  and twined garlands  so they did not go either \\r\\nand when the others reached the willow-tree  where the confectioner was \\r\\nthey said  “now we are there  in reality the bell does not exist  it is\\r\\nonly a fancy that people have taken into their heads ”\\r\\n\\r\\nat the same moment the bell sounded deep in the wood  so clear and\\r\\nsolemnly that five or six determined to penetrate somewhat further  it\\r\\nwas so thick  and the foliage so dense  that it was quite fatiguing\\r\\nto proceed  woodroof and anemonies grew almost too high  blooming\\r\\nconvolvuluses and blackberry-bushes hung in long garlands from tree to\\r\\ntree  where the nightingale sang and the sunbeams were playing: it was\\r\\nvery beautiful  but it was no place for girls to go  their clothes would\\r\\nget so torn  large blocks of stone lay there  overgrown with moss of\\r\\nevery color  the fresh spring bubbled forth  and made a strange gurgling\\r\\nsound \\r\\n\\r\\n“that surely cannot be the bell ” said one of the children  lying down\\r\\nand listening  “this must be looked to ” so he remained  and let the\\r\\nothers go on without him \\r\\n\\r\\nthey afterwards came to a little house  made of branches and the bark of\\r\\ntrees  a large wild apple-tree bent over it  as if it would shower down\\r\\nall its blessings on the roof  where roses were blooming  the long stems\\r\\ntwined round the gable  on which there hung a small bell \\r\\n\\r\\nwas it that which people had heard? yes  everybody was unanimous on the\\r\\nsubject  except one  who said that the bell was too small and too fine\\r\\nto be heard at so great a distance  and besides it was very different\\r\\ntones to those that could move a human heart in such a manner  it was a\\r\\nking's son who spoke  whereon the others said  “such people always want\\r\\nto be wiser than everybody else ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthey now let him go on alone  and as he went  his breast was filled more\\r\\nand more with the forest solitude  but he still heard the little bell\\r\\nwith which the others were so satisfied  and now and then  when the\\r\\nwind blew  he could also hear the people singing who were sitting at tea\\r\\nwhere the confectioner had his tent  but the deep sound of the bell rose\\r\\nlouder  it was almost as if an organ were accompanying it  and the tones\\r\\ncame from the left hand  the side where the heart is placed  a rustling\\r\\nwas heard in the bushes  and a little boy stood before the king's son  a\\r\\nboy in wooden shoes  and with so short a jacket that one could see what\\r\\nlong wrists he had  both knew each other: the boy was that one among\\r\\nthe children who could not come because he had to go home and return his\\r\\njacket and boots to the innkeeper's son  this he had done  and was now\\r\\ngoing on in wooden shoes and in his humble dress  for the bell sounded\\r\\nwith so deep a tone  and with such strange power  that proceed he must \\r\\n\\r\\n“why  then  we can go together ” said the king's son  but the poor\\r\\nchild that had been confirmed was quite ashamed  he looked at his wooden\\r\\nshoes  pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket  and said that he was\\r\\nafraid he could not walk so fast  besides  he thought that the bell must\\r\\nbe looked for to the right  for that was the place where all sorts of\\r\\nbeautiful things were to be found \\r\\n\\r\\n“but there we shall not meet ” said the king's son  nodding at the same\\r\\ntime to the poor boy  who went into the darkest  thickest part of the\\r\\nwood  where thorns tore his humble dress  and scratched his face and\\r\\nhands and feet till they bled  the king's son got some scratches too \\r\\nbut the sun shone on his path  and it is him that we will follow  for he\\r\\nwas an excellent and resolute youth \\r\\n\\r\\n“i must and will find the bell ” said he  “even if i am obliged to go to\\r\\nthe end of the world ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe ugly apes sat upon the trees  and grinned  “shall we thrash him?”\\r\\n said they  “shall we thrash him? he is the son of a king ”\\r\\n\\r\\nbut on he went  without being disheartened  deeper and deeper into the\\r\\nwood  where the most wonderful flowers were growing  there stood white\\r\\nlilies with blood-red stamina  skyblue tulips  which shone as they waved\\r\\nin the winds  and apple-trees  the apples of which looked exactly like\\r\\nlarge soapbubbles: so only think how the trees must have sparkled in the\\r\\nsunshine  around the nicest green meads  where the deer were playing in\\r\\nthe grass  grew magnificent oaks and beeches  and if the bark of one of\\r\\nthe trees was cracked  there grass and long creeping plants grew in\\r\\nthe crevices  and there were large calm lakes there too  in which white\\r\\nswans were swimming  and beat the air with their wings  the king's son\\r\\noften stood still and listened  he thought the bell sounded from the\\r\\ndepths of these still lakes  but then he remarked again that the tone\\r\\nproceeded not from there  but farther off  from out the depths of the\\r\\nforest \\r\\n\\r\\nthe sun now set: the atmosphere glowed like fire  it was still in the\\r\\nwoods  so very still  and he fell on his knees  sung his evening hymn \\r\\nand said: “i cannot find what i seek  the sun is going down  and night\\r\\nis comingthe dark  dark night  yet perhaps i may be able once more\\r\\nto see the round red sun before he entirely disappears  i will climb up\\r\\nyonder rock ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand he seized hold of the creeping-plants  and the roots of\\r\\ntreesclimbed up the moist stones where the water-snakes were writhing\\r\\nand the toads were croakingand he gained the summit before the sun\\r\\nhad quite gone down  how magnificent was the sight from this height  the\\r\\nseathe great  the glorious sea  that dashed its long waves against the\\r\\ncoastwas stretched out before him  and yonder  where sea and sky meet \\r\\nstood the sun  like a large shining altar  all melted together in the\\r\\nmost glowing colors  and the wood and the sea sang a song of rejoicing \\r\\nand his heart sang with the rest: all nature was a vast holy church \\r\\nin which the trees and the buoyant clouds were the pillars  flowers and\\r\\ngrass the velvet carpeting  and heaven itself the large cupola  the red\\r\\ncolors above faded away as the sun vanished  but a million stars were\\r\\nlighted  a million lamps shone  and the king's son spread out his arms\\r\\ntowards heaven  and wood  and sea  when at the same moment  coming by\\r\\na path to the right  appeared  in his wooden shoes and jacket  the poor\\r\\nboy who had been confirmed with him  he had followed his own path  and\\r\\nhad reached the spot just as soon as the son of the king had done  they\\r\\nran towards each other  and stood together hand in hand in the vast\\r\\nchurch of nature and of poetry  while over them sounded the invisible\\r\\nholy bell: blessed spirits floated around them  and lifted up their\\r\\nvoices in a rejoicing hallelujah \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe old house\\r\\n\\r\\nin the street  up there  was an old  a very old houseit was almost\\r\\nthree hundred years old  for that might be known by reading the great\\r\\nbeam on which the date of the year was carved: together with tulips and\\r\\nhop-binds there were whole verses spelled as in former times  and over\\r\\nevery window was a distorted face cut out in the beam  the one story\\r\\nstood forward a great way over the other  and directly under the eaves\\r\\nwas a leaden spout with a dragon's head  the rain-water should have run\\r\\nout of the mouth  but it ran out of the belly  for there was a hole in\\r\\nthe spout \\r\\n\\r\\nall the other houses in the street were so new and so neat  with large\\r\\nwindow panes and smooth walls  one could easily see that they would have\\r\\nnothing to do with the old house: they certainly thought  “how long is\\r\\nthat old decayed thing to stand here as a spectacle in the street? and\\r\\nthen the projecting windows stand so far out  that no one can see from\\r\\nour windows what happens in that direction  the steps are as broad as\\r\\nthose of a palace  and as high as to a church tower  the iron railings\\r\\nlook just like the door to an old family vault  and then they have brass\\r\\ntopsthat's so stupid ”\\r\\n\\r\\non the other side of the street were also new and neat houses  and they\\r\\nthought just as the others did  but at the window opposite the old house\\r\\nthere sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks and bright beaming eyes:\\r\\nhe certainly liked the old house best  and that both in sunshine and\\r\\nmoonshine  and when he looked across at the wall where the mortar\\r\\nhad fallen out  he could sit and find out there the strangest figures\\r\\nimaginable  exactly as the street had appeared before  with steps \\r\\nprojecting windows  and pointed gables  he could see soldiers with\\r\\nhalberds  and spouts where the water ran  like dragons and serpents \\r\\nthat was a house to look at  and there lived an old man  who wore plush\\r\\nbreeches  and he had a coat with large brass buttons  and a wig that one\\r\\ncould see was a real wig  every morning there came an old fellow to him\\r\\nwho put his rooms in order  and went on errands  otherwise  the old man\\r\\nin the plush breeches was quite alone in the old house  now and then he\\r\\ncame to the window and looked out  and the little boy nodded to him \\r\\nand the old man nodded again  and so they became acquaintances  and then\\r\\nthey were friends  although they had never spoken to each otherbut\\r\\nthat made no difference  the little boy heard his parents say  “the old\\r\\nman opposite is very well off  but he is so very  very lonely ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe sunday following  the little boy took something  and wrapped it up\\r\\nin a piece of paper  went downstairs  and stood in the doorway  and when\\r\\nthe man who went on errands came past  he said to him\\r\\n\\r\\n“i say  master  will you give this to the old man over the way from me?\\r\\ni have two pewter soldiersthis is one of them  and he shall have it \\r\\nfor i know he is so very  very lonely ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the old errand man looked quite pleased  nodded  and took the pewter\\r\\nsoldier over to the old house  afterwards there came a message  it was\\r\\nto ask if the little boy himself had not a wish to come over and pay a\\r\\nvisit  and so he got permission of his parents  and then went over to\\r\\nthe old house \\r\\n\\r\\nand the brass balls on the iron railings shone much brighter than ever \\r\\none would have thought they were polished on account of the visit  and\\r\\nit was as if the carved-out trumpetersfor there were trumpeters  who\\r\\nstood in tulips  carved out on the doorblew with all their\\r\\nmight  their cheeks appeared so much rounder than before  yes  they\\r\\nblew“trateratra  the little boy comes  trateratra ”and then the door\\r\\nopened \\r\\n\\r\\nthe whole passage was hung with portraits of knights in armor  and\\r\\nladies in silken gowns  and the armor rattled  and the silken gowns\\r\\nrustled  and then there was a flight of stairs which went a good way\\r\\nupwards  and a little way downwards  and then one came on a balcony\\r\\nwhich was in a very dilapidated state  sure enough  with large holes and\\r\\nlong crevices  but grass grew there and leaves out of them altogether \\r\\nfor the whole balcony outside  the yard  and the walls  were overgrown\\r\\nwith so much green stuff  that it looked like a garden  only a balcony \\r\\nhere stood old flower-pots with faces and asses' ears  and the flowers\\r\\ngrew just as they liked  one of the pots was quite overrun on all sides\\r\\nwith pinks  that is to say  with the green part  shoot stood by shoot \\r\\nand it said quite distinctly  “the air has cherished me  the sun has\\r\\nkissed me  and promised me a little flower on sunday  a little flower on\\r\\nsunday ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered with hog's\\r\\nleather  and printed with gold flowers \\r\\n\\r\\n   “the gilding decays \\r\\n   but hog's leather stays ”\\r\\n\\r\\nsaid the walls \\r\\n\\r\\nand there stood easy-chairs  with such high backs  and so carved out \\r\\nand with arms on both sides  “sit down  sit down ” said they  “ugh  how\\r\\ni creak  now i shall certainly get the gout  like the old clothespress \\r\\nugh ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand then the little boy came into the room where the projecting windows\\r\\nwere  and where the old man sat \\r\\n\\r\\n“i thank you for the pewter soldier  my little friend ” said the old\\r\\nman  “and i thank you because you come over to me ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“thankee  thankee ” or “cranky  cranky ” sounded from all the furniture \\r\\nthere was so much of it  that each article stood in the other's way  to\\r\\nget a look at the little boy \\r\\n\\r\\nin the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful lady \\r\\nso young  so glad  but dressed quite as in former times  with clothes\\r\\nthat stood quite stiff  and with powder in her hair  she neither said\\r\\n“thankee  thankee ” nor “cranky  cranky ” but looked with her mild eyes\\r\\nat the little boy  who directly asked the old man  “where did you get\\r\\nher?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yonder  at the broker's ” said the old man  “where there are so many\\r\\npictures hanging  no one knows or cares about them  for they are all of\\r\\nthem buried  but i knew her in by-gone days  and now she has been dead\\r\\nand gone these fifty years ”\\r\\n\\r\\nunder the picture  in a glazed frame  there hung a bouquet of withered\\r\\nflowers  they were almost fifty years old  they looked so very old \\r\\n\\r\\nthe pendulum of the great clock went to and fro  and the hands turned \\r\\nand everything in the room became still older  but they did not observe\\r\\nit \\r\\n\\r\\n“they say at home ” said the little boy  “that you are so very  very\\r\\nlonely ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh ” said he  “the old thoughts  with what they may bring with them \\r\\ncome and visit me  and now you also come  i am very well off ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthen he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf  there were\\r\\nwhole long processions and pageants  with the strangest characters \\r\\nwhich one never sees now-a-days  soldiers like the knave of clubs \\r\\nand citizens with waving flags: the tailors had theirs  with a pair of\\r\\nshears held by two lionsand the shoemakers theirs  without boots \\r\\nbut with an eagle that had two heads  for the shoemakers must have\\r\\neverything so that they can say  it is a pair  yes  that was a picture\\r\\nbook \\r\\n\\r\\nthe old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves  apples  and\\r\\nnutsyes  it was delightful over there in the old house \\r\\n\\r\\n“i cannot bear it any longer ” said the pewter soldier  who sat on the\\r\\ndrawers  “it is so lonely and melancholy here  but when one has been in\\r\\na family circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life  i cannot bear\\r\\nit any longer  the whole day is so long  and the evenings are still\\r\\nlonger  here it is not at all as it is over the way at your home  where\\r\\nyour father and mother spoke so pleasantly  and where you and all your\\r\\nsweet children made such a delightful noise  nay  how lonely the old man\\r\\nisdo you think that he gets kisses? do you think he gets mild eyes \\r\\nor a christmas tree? he will get nothing but a grave  i can bear it no\\r\\nlonger ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“you must not let it grieve you so much ” said the little boy  “i find\\r\\nit so very delightful here  and then all the old thoughts  with what\\r\\nthey may bring with them  they come and visit here ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  it's all very well  but i see nothing of them  and i don't know\\r\\nthem ” said the pewter soldier  “i cannot bear it ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“but you must ” said the little boy \\r\\n\\r\\nthen in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face  the most\\r\\ndelicious preserves  apples  and nuts  and so the little boy thought no\\r\\nmore about the pewter soldier \\r\\n\\r\\nthe little boy returned home happy and pleased  and weeks and days\\r\\npassed away  and nods were made to the old house  and from the old\\r\\nhouse  and then the little boy went over there again \\r\\n\\r\\nthe carved trumpeters blew  “trateratra  there is the little boy \\r\\ntrateratra ” and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits rattled \\r\\nand the silk gowns rustled  the hog's leather spoke  and the old chairs\\r\\nhad the gout in their legs and rheumatism in their backs: ugh  it was\\r\\nexactly like the first time  for over there one day and hour was just\\r\\nlike another \\r\\n\\r\\n“i cannot bear it ” said the pewter soldier  “i have shed pewter tears \\r\\nit is too melancholy  rather let me go to the wars and lose arms and\\r\\nlegs  it would at least be a change  i cannot bear it longer  now  i\\r\\nknow what it is to have a visit from one's old thoughts  with what they\\r\\nmay bring with them  i have had a visit from mine  and you may be sure\\r\\nit is no pleasant thing in the end  i was at last about to jump down\\r\\nfrom the drawers \\r\\n\\r\\n“i saw you all over there at home so distinctly  as if you really were\\r\\nhere  it was again that sunday morning  all you children stood before\\r\\nthe table and sung your psalms  as you do every morning  you stood\\r\\ndevoutly with folded hands  and father and mother were just as pious \\r\\nand then the door was opened  and little sister mary  who is not two\\r\\nyears old yet  and who always dances when she hears music or singing  of\\r\\nwhatever kind it may be  was put into the roomthough she ought not to\\r\\nhave been thereand then she began to dance  but could not keep time \\r\\nbecause the tones were so long  and then she stood  first on the one\\r\\nleg  and bent her head forwards  and then on the other leg  and bent\\r\\nher head forwardsbut all would not do  you stood very seriously all\\r\\ntogether  although it was difficult enough  but i laughed to myself  and\\r\\nthen i fell off the table  and got a bump  which i have stillfor it\\r\\nwas not right of me to laugh  but the whole now passes before me again\\r\\nin thought  and everything that i have lived to see  and these are the\\r\\nold thoughts  with what they may bring with them \\r\\n\\r\\n“tell me if you still sing on sundays? tell me something about little\\r\\nmary  and how my comrade  the other pewter soldier  lives  yes  he is\\r\\nhappy enough  that's sure  i cannot bear it any longer ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“you are given away as a present ” said the little boy  “you must\\r\\nremain  can you not understand that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe old man now came with a drawer  in which there was much to be seen \\r\\nboth “tin boxes” and “balsam boxes ” old cards  so large and so gilded \\r\\nsuch as one never sees them now  and several drawers were opened  and\\r\\nthe piano was opened  it had landscapes on the inside of the lid  and it\\r\\nwas so hoarse when the old man played on it  and then he hummed a song \\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  she could sing that ” said he  and nodded to the portrait  which\\r\\nhe had bought at the broker's  and the old man's eyes shone so bright \\r\\n\\r\\n“i will go to the wars  i will go to the wars ” shouted the pewter\\r\\nsoldier as loud as he could  and threw himself off the drawers right\\r\\ndown on the floor  what became of him? the old man sought  and the\\r\\nlittle boy sought  he was away  and he stayed away \\r\\n\\r\\n“i shall find him ” said the old man  but he never found him  the floor\\r\\nwas too openthe pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice  and there\\r\\nhe lay as in an open tomb \\r\\n\\r\\nthat day passed  and the little boy went home  and that week passed \\r\\nand several weeks too  the windows were quite frozen  the little boy was\\r\\nobliged to sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the old\\r\\nhouse  and there the snow had been blown into all the carved work and\\r\\ninscriptions  it lay quite up over the steps  just as if there was no\\r\\none at homenor was there any one at homethe old man was dead \\r\\n\\r\\nin the evening there was a hearse seen before the door  and he was borne\\r\\ninto it in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country  to lie in\\r\\nhis grave  he was driven out there  but no one followed  all his friends\\r\\nwere dead  and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as it was\\r\\ndriven away \\r\\n\\r\\nsome days afterwards there was an auction at the old house  and the\\r\\nlittle boy saw from his window how they carried the old knights and the\\r\\nold ladies away  the flower-pots with the long ears  the old chairs  and\\r\\nthe old clothes-presses  something came here  and something came there \\r\\nthe portrait of her who had been found at the broker's came to the\\r\\nbroker's again  and there it hung  for no one knew her moreno one\\r\\ncared about the old picture \\r\\n\\r\\nin the spring they pulled the house down  for  as people said  it was\\r\\na ruin  one could see from the street right into the room with the\\r\\nhog's-leather hanging  which was slashed and torn  and the green grass\\r\\nand leaves about the balcony hung quite wild about the falling beams \\r\\nand then it was put to rights \\r\\n\\r\\n“that was a relief ” said the neighboring houses \\r\\n\\r\\na fine house was built there  with large windows  and smooth white\\r\\nwalls  but before it  where the old house had in fact stood  was a\\r\\nlittle garden laid out  and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the\\r\\nneighboring house  before the garden there was a large iron railing\\r\\nwith an iron door  it looked quite splendid  and people stood still and\\r\\npeeped in  and the sparrows hung by scores in the vine  and chattered\\r\\naway at each other as well as they could  but it was not about the old\\r\\nhouse  for they could not remember it  so many years had passedso many\\r\\nthat the little boy had grown up to a whole man  yes  a clever man  and\\r\\na pleasure to his parents  and he had just been married  and  together\\r\\nwith his little wife  had come to live in the house here  where the\\r\\ngarden was  and he stood by her there whilst she planted a field-flower\\r\\nthat she found so pretty  she planted it with her little hand  and\\r\\npressed the earth around it with her fingers  oh  what was that? she\\r\\nhad stuck herself  there sat something pointed  straight out of the soft\\r\\nmould \\r\\n\\r\\nit wasyes  guess  it was the pewter soldier  he that was lost up at\\r\\nthe old man's  and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and\\r\\nthe rubbish  and had at last laid for many years in the ground \\r\\n\\r\\nthe young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier  first with a green leaf \\r\\nand then with her fine handkerchiefit had such a delightful smell \\r\\nthat it was to the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from a\\r\\ntrance \\r\\n\\r\\n“let me see him ” said the young man  he laughed  and then shook his\\r\\nhead  “nay  it cannot be he  but he reminds me of a story about a pewter\\r\\nsoldier which i had when i was a little boy ” and then he told his wife\\r\\nabout the old house  and the old man  and about the pewter soldier that\\r\\nhe sent over to him because he was so very  very lonely  and he told it\\r\\nas correctly as it had really been  so that the tears came into the eyes\\r\\nof his young wife  on account of the old house and the old man \\r\\n\\r\\n“it may possibly be  however  that it is the same pewter soldier ” said\\r\\nshe  “i will take care of it  and remember all that you have told me \\r\\nbut you must show me the old man's grave ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“but i do not know it ” said he  “and no one knows it  all his friends\\r\\nwere dead  no one took care of it  and i was then a little boy ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“how very  very lonely he must have been ” said she \\r\\n\\r\\n“very  very lonely ” said the pewter soldier  “but it is delightful not\\r\\nto be forgotten ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“delightful ” shouted something close by  but no one  except the pewter\\r\\nsoldier  saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings  it had\\r\\nlost all its gilding  it looked like a piece of wet clay  but it had an\\r\\nopinion  and it gave it:\\r\\n\\r\\n   “the gilding decays \\r\\n   but hog's leather stays ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthis the pewter soldier did not believe \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe happy family\\r\\n\\r\\nreally  the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf  if one\\r\\nholds it before one  it is like a whole apron  and if one holds it over\\r\\none's head in rainy weather  it is almost as good as an umbrella  for\\r\\nit is so immensely large  the burdock never grows alone  but where there\\r\\ngrows one there always grow several: it is a great delight  and all this\\r\\ndelightfulness is snails' food  the great white snails which persons of\\r\\nquality in former times made fricassees of  ate  and said  “hem \\r\\nhem  how delicious ” for they thought it tasted so delicatelived on\\r\\ndock-leaves  and therefore burdock seeds were sown \\r\\n\\r\\nnow  there was an old manor-house  where they no longer ate snails  they\\r\\nwere quite extinct  but the burdocks were not extinct  they grew and\\r\\ngrew all over the walks and all the beds  they could not get the mastery\\r\\nover themit was a whole forest of burdocks  here and there stood an\\r\\napple and a plum-tree  or else one never would have thought that it was\\r\\na garden  all was burdocks  and there lived the two last venerable old\\r\\nsnails \\r\\n\\r\\nthey themselves knew not how old they were  but they could remember\\r\\nvery well that there had been many more  that they were of a family\\r\\nfrom foreign lands  and that for them and theirs the whole forest was\\r\\nplanted  they had never been outside it  but they knew that there was\\r\\nstill something more in the world  which was called the manor-house  and\\r\\nthat there they were boiled  and then they became black  and were then\\r\\nplaced on a silver dish  but what happened further they knew not  or  in\\r\\nfact  what it was to be boiled  and to lie on a silver dish  they could\\r\\nnot possibly imagine  but it was said to be delightful  and particularly\\r\\ngenteel  neither the chafers  the toads  nor the earth-worms  whom they\\r\\nasked about it could give them any informationnone of them had been\\r\\nboiled or laid on a silver dish \\r\\n\\r\\nthe old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the\\r\\nworld  that they knew  the forest was planted for their sake  and the\\r\\nmanor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver\\r\\ndish \\r\\n\\r\\nnow they lived a very lonely and happy life  and as they had no children\\r\\nthemselves  they had adopted a little common snail  which they brought\\r\\nup as their own  but the little one would not grow  for he was of a\\r\\ncommon family  but the old ones  especially dame mother snail  thought\\r\\nthey could observe how he increased in size  and she begged father \\r\\nif he could not see it  that he would at least feel the little snail's\\r\\nshell  and then he felt it  and found the good dame was right \\r\\n\\r\\none day there was a heavy storm of rain \\r\\n\\r\\n“hear how it beats like a drum on the dock-leaves ” said father snail \\r\\n\\r\\n“there are also rain-drops ” said mother snail  “and now the rain pours\\r\\nright down the stalk  you will see that it will be wet here  i am very\\r\\nhappy to think that we have our good house  and the little one has\\r\\nhis also  there is more done for us than for all other creatures  sure\\r\\nenough  but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world?\\r\\nwe are provided with a house from our birth  and the burdock forest is\\r\\nplanted for our sakes  i should like to know how far it extends  and\\r\\nwhat there is outside ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“there is nothing at all ” said father snail  “no place can be better\\r\\nthan ours  and i have nothing to wish for ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes ” said the dame  “i would willingly go to the manorhouse  be\\r\\nboiled  and laid on a silver dish  all our forefathers have been treated\\r\\nso  there is something extraordinary in it  you may be sure ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“the manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin ” said father snail  “or\\r\\nthe burdocks have grown up over it  so that they cannot come out  there\\r\\nneed not  however  be any haste about that  but you are always in such a\\r\\ntremendous hurry  and the little one is beginning to be the same  has he\\r\\nnot been creeping up that stalk these three days? it gives me a headache\\r\\nwhen i look up to him ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“you must not scold him ” said mother snail  “he creeps so carefully  he\\r\\nwill afford us much pleasureand we have nothing but him to live for \\r\\nbut have you not thought of it? where shall we get a wife for him? do\\r\\nyou not think that there are some of our species at a great distance in\\r\\nthe interior of the burdock forest?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“black snails  i dare say  there are enough of ” said the old one \\r\\n“black snails without a housebut they are so common  and so conceited \\r\\nbut we might give the ants a commission to look out for us  they run\\r\\nto and fro as if they had something to do  and they certainly know of a\\r\\nwife for our little snail ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i know one  sure enoughthe most charming one ” said one of the ants \\r\\n“but i am afraid we shall hardly succeed  for she is a queen ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that is nothing ” said the old folks  “has she a house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“she has a palace ” said the ant  “the finest ant's palace  with seven\\r\\nhundred passages ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i thank you ” said mother snail  “our son shall not go into an\\r\\nant-hill  if you know nothing better than that  we shall give the\\r\\ncommission to the white gnats  they fly far and wide  in rain and\\r\\nsunshine  they know the whole forest here  both within and without ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“we have a wife for him ” said the gnats  “at a hundred human paces from\\r\\nhere there sits a little snail in her house  on a gooseberry bush  she\\r\\nis quite lonely  and old enough to be married  it is only a hundred\\r\\nhuman paces ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“well  then  let her come to him ” said the old ones  “he has a whole\\r\\nforest of burdocks  she has only a bush ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand so they went and fetched little miss snail  it was a whole week\\r\\nbefore she arrived  but therein was just the very best of it  for one\\r\\ncould thus see that she was of the same species \\r\\n\\r\\nand then the marriage was celebrated  six earth-worms shone as well as\\r\\nthey could  in other respects the whole went off very quietly  for the\\r\\nold folks could not bear noise and merriment  but old dame snail made\\r\\na brilliant speech  father snail could not speak  he was too much\\r\\naffected  and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance  the whole\\r\\nforest of burdocks  and saidwhat they had always saidthat it was\\r\\nthe best in the world  and if they lived honestly and decently  and\\r\\nincreased and multiplied  they and their children would once in the\\r\\ncourse of time come to the manor-house  be boiled black  and laid on\\r\\nsilver dishes  after this speech was made  the old ones crept into their\\r\\nshells  and never more came out  they slept  the young couple governed\\r\\nin the forest  and had a numerous progeny  but they were never boiled \\r\\nand never came on the silver dishes  so from this they concluded that\\r\\nthe manor-house had fallen to ruins  and that all the men in the world\\r\\nwere extinct  and as no one contradicted them  so  of course it was so \\r\\nand the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake \\r\\nand the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their\\r\\nsakes  and they were very happy  and the whole family was happy  for\\r\\nthey  indeed were so \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe story of a mother\\r\\n\\r\\na mother sat there with her little child  she was so downcast  so\\r\\nafraid that it should die  it was so pale  the small eyes had closed\\r\\nthemselves  and it drew its breath so softly  now and then  with a\\r\\ndeep respiration  as if it sighed  and the mother looked still more\\r\\nsorrowfully on the little creature \\r\\n\\r\\nthen a knocking was heard at the door  and in came a poor old man\\r\\nwrapped up as in a large horse-cloth  for it warms one  and he needed\\r\\nit  as it was the cold winter season  everything out-of-doors was\\r\\ncovered with ice and snow  and the wind blew so that it cut the face \\r\\n\\r\\nas the old man trembled with cold  and the little child slept a moment \\r\\nthe mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove \\r\\nthat it might be warm for him  the old man sat and rocked the cradle \\r\\nand the mother sat down on a chair close by him  and looked at her\\r\\nlittle sick child that drew its breath so deep  and raised its little\\r\\nhand \\r\\n\\r\\n“do you not think that i shall save him?” said she  “our lord will not\\r\\ntake him from me ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the old manit was death himselfhe nodded so strangely  it could\\r\\njust as well signify yes as no  and the mother looked down in her lap \\r\\nand the tears ran down over her cheeks  her head became so heavyshe\\r\\nhad not closed her eyes for three days and nights  and now she slept \\r\\nbut only for a minute  when she started up and trembled with cold \\r\\n\\r\\n“what is that?” said she  and looked on all sides  but the old man was\\r\\ngone  and her little child was gonehe had taken it with him  and the\\r\\nold clock in the corner burred  and burred  the great leaden weight ran\\r\\ndown to the floor  bump  and then the clock also stood still \\r\\n\\r\\nbut the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child \\r\\n\\r\\nout there  in the midst of the snow  there sat a woman in long  black\\r\\nclothes  and she said  “death has been in thy chamber  and i saw him\\r\\nhasten away with thy little child  he goes faster than the wind  and he\\r\\nnever brings back what he takes ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  only tell me which way he went ” said the mother  “tell me the way \\r\\nand i shall find him ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i know it ” said the woman in the black clothes  “but before i tell it \\r\\nthou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child \\r\\ni am fond of them  i have heard them before  i am night  i saw thy tears\\r\\nwhilst thou sang'st them ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i will sing them all  all ” said the mother  “but do not stop me nowi\\r\\nmay overtake himi may find my child ”\\r\\n\\r\\nbut night stood still and mute  then the mother wrung her hands  sang\\r\\nand wept  and there were many songs  but yet many more tears  and then\\r\\nnight said  “go to the right  into the dark pine forest  thither i saw\\r\\ndeath take his way with thy little child ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest  and she no\\r\\nlonger knew whither she should go  then there stood a thorn-bush \\r\\nthere was neither leaf nor flower on it  it was also in the cold winter\\r\\nseason  and ice-flakes hung on the branches \\r\\n\\r\\n“hast thou not seen death go past with my little child?” said the\\r\\nmother \\r\\n\\r\\n“yes ” said the thorn-bush  “but i will not tell thee which way he took \\r\\nunless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart  i am freezing to death \\r\\ni shall become a lump of ice ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand she pressed the thorn-bush to her breast  so firmly  that it might\\r\\nbe thoroughly warmed  and the thorns went right into her flesh  and her\\r\\nblood flowed in large drops  but the thornbush shot forth fresh green\\r\\nleaves  and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night  the heart\\r\\nof the afflicted mother was so warm  and the thorn-bush told her the way\\r\\nshe should go \\r\\n\\r\\nshe then came to a large lake  where there was neither ship nor boat \\r\\nthe lake was not frozen sufficiently to bear her  neither was it open \\r\\nnor low enough that she could wade through it  and across it she must go\\r\\nif she would find her child  then she lay down to drink up the lake  and\\r\\nthat was an impossibility for a human being  but the afflicted mother\\r\\nthought that a miracle might happen nevertheless \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  what would i not give to come to my child ” said the weeping\\r\\nmother  and she wept still more  and her eyes sunk down in the depths of\\r\\nthe waters  and became two precious pearls  but the water bore her up \\r\\nas if she sat in a swing  and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore\\r\\non the opposite side  where there stood a mile-broad  strange house  one\\r\\nknew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns  or if it were\\r\\nbuilt up  but the poor mother could not see it  she had wept her eyes\\r\\nout \\r\\n\\r\\n“where shall i find death  who took away my little child?” said she \\r\\n\\r\\n“he has not come here yet ” said the old grave woman  who was appointed\\r\\nto look after death's great greenhouse  “how have you been able to find\\r\\nthe way hither? and who has helped you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“our lord has helped me ” said she  “he is merciful  and you will also\\r\\nbe so  where shall i find my little child?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“nay  i know not ” said the woman  “and you cannot see  many flowers and\\r\\ntrees have withered this night  death will soon come and plant them over\\r\\nagain  you certainly know that every person has his or her life's tree\\r\\nor flower  just as everyone happens to be settled  they look like other\\r\\nplants  but they have pulsations of the heart  children's hearts can\\r\\nalso beat  go after yours  perhaps you may know your child's  but what\\r\\nwill you give me if i tell you what you shall do more?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i have nothing to give ” said the afflicted mother  “but i will go to\\r\\nthe world's end for you ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“nay  i have nothing to do there ” said the woman  “but you can give\\r\\nme your long black hair  you know yourself that it is fine  and that\\r\\ni like  you shall have my white hair instead  and that's always\\r\\nsomething ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“do you demand nothing else?” said she  “that i will gladly give you ”\\r\\n and she gave her her fine black hair  and got the old woman's snow-white\\r\\nhair instead \\r\\n\\r\\nso they went into death's great greenhouse  where flowers and trees\\r\\ngrew strangely into one another  there stood fine hyacinths under glass\\r\\nbells  and there stood strong-stemmed peonies  there grew water plants \\r\\nsome so fresh  others half sick  the water-snakes lay down on them \\r\\nand black crabs pinched their stalks  there stood beautiful palm-trees \\r\\noaks  and plantains  there stood parsley and flowering thyme: every tree\\r\\nand every flower had its name  each of them was a human life  the human\\r\\nframe still livedone in china  and another in greenlandround about\\r\\nin the world  there were large trees in small pots  so that they stood\\r\\nso stunted in growth  and ready to burst the pots  in other places \\r\\nthere was a little dull flower in rich mould  with moss round about it \\r\\nand it was so petted and nursed  but the distressed mother bent down\\r\\nover all the smallest plants  and heard within them how the human heart\\r\\nbeat  and amongst millions she knew her child's \\r\\n\\r\\n“there it is ” cried she  and stretched her hands out over a little blue\\r\\ncrocus  that hung quite sickly on one side \\r\\n\\r\\n“don't touch the flower ” said the old woman  “but place yourself here \\r\\nand when death comesi expect him every momentdo not let him pluck\\r\\nthe flower up  but threaten him that you will do the same with the\\r\\nothers  then he will be afraid  he is responsible for them to our lord \\r\\nand no one dares to pluck them up before he gives leave ”\\r\\n\\r\\nall at once an icy cold rushed through the great hall  and the blind\\r\\nmother could feel that it was death that came \\r\\n\\r\\n“how hast thou been able to find thy way hither?” he asked  “how couldst\\r\\nthou come quicker than i?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i am a mother ” said she \\r\\n\\r\\nand death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower \\r\\nbut she held her hands fast around his  so tight  and yet afraid that\\r\\nshe should touch one of the leaves  then death blew on her hands  and\\r\\nshe felt that it was colder than the cold wind  and her hands fell down\\r\\npowerless \\r\\n\\r\\n“thou canst not do anything against me ” said death \\r\\n\\r\\n“but our lord can ” said she \\r\\n\\r\\n“i only do his bidding ” said death  “i am his gardener  i take all his\\r\\nflowers and trees  and plant them out in the great garden of paradise \\r\\nin the unknown land  but how they grow there  and how it is there i dare\\r\\nnot tell thee ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“give me back my child ” said the mother  and she wept and prayed  at\\r\\nonce she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by  with each hand \\r\\nand cried out to death  “i will tear all thy flowers off  for i am in\\r\\ndespair ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“touch them not ” said death  “thou say'st that thou art so unhappy  and\\r\\nnow thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“another mother ” said the poor woman  and directly let go her hold of\\r\\nboth the flowers \\r\\n\\r\\n“there  thou hast thine eyes ” said death  “i fished them up from the\\r\\nlake  they shone so bright  i knew not they were thine  take them again \\r\\nthey are now brighter than before  now look down into the deep well\\r\\nclose by  i shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst\\r\\nhave torn up  and thou wilt see their whole future lifetheir whole\\r\\nhuman existence: and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand she looked down into the well  and it was a happiness to see how the\\r\\none became a blessing to the world  to see how much happiness and joy\\r\\nwere felt everywhere  and she saw the other's life  and it was sorrow\\r\\nand distress  horror  and wretchedness \\r\\n\\r\\n“both of them are god's will ” said death \\r\\n\\r\\n“which of them is misfortune's flower and which is that of happiness?”\\r\\n asked she \\r\\n\\r\\n“that i will not tell thee ” said death  “but this thou shalt know from\\r\\nme  that the one flower was thy own child  it was thy child's fate thou\\r\\nsaw'stthy own child's future life ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthen the mother screamed with terror  “which of them was my child? tell\\r\\nit me  save the innocent  save my child from all that misery  rather\\r\\ntake it away  take it into god's kingdom  forget my tears  forget my\\r\\nprayers  and all that i have done ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i do not understand thee ” said death  “wilt thou have thy child again \\r\\nor shall i go with it there  where thou dost not know ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthen the mother wrung her hands  fell on her knees  and prayed to our\\r\\nlord: “oh  hear me not when i pray against thy will  which is the best \\r\\nhear me not  hear me not ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand she bowed her head down in her lap  and death took her child and\\r\\nwent with it into the unknown land \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe false collar\\r\\n\\r\\nthere was once a fine gentleman  all of whose moveables were a boot-jack\\r\\nand a hair-comb: but he had the finest false collars in the world  and\\r\\nit is about one of these collars that we are now to hear a story \\r\\n\\r\\nit was so old  that it began to think of marriage  and it happened that\\r\\nit came to be washed in company with a garter \\r\\n\\r\\n“nay ” said the collar  “i never did see anything so slender and so\\r\\nfine  so soft and so neat  may i not ask your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that i shall not tell you ” said the garter \\r\\n\\r\\n“where do you live?” asked the collar \\r\\n\\r\\nbut the garter was so bashful  so modest  and thought it was a strange\\r\\nquestion to answer \\r\\n\\r\\n“you are certainly a girdle ” said the collar  “that is to say an inside\\r\\ngirdle  i see well that you are both for use and ornament  my dear young\\r\\nlady ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i will thank you not to speak to me ” said the garter  “i think i have\\r\\nnot given the least occasion for it ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  when one is as handsome as you ” said the collar  “that is\\r\\noccasion enough ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“don't come so near me  i beg of you ” said the garter  “you look so\\r\\nmuch like those men-folks ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i am also a fine gentleman ” said the collar  “i have a bootjack and a\\r\\nhair-comb ”\\r\\n\\r\\nbut that was not true  for it was his master who had them: but he\\r\\nboasted \\r\\n\\r\\n“don't come so near me ” said the garter: “i am not accustomed to it ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“prude ” exclaimed the collar  and then it was taken out of the\\r\\nwashing-tub  it was starched  hung over the back of a chair in the\\r\\nsunshine  and was then laid on the ironing-blanket  then came the warm\\r\\nbox-iron  “dear lady ” said the collar  “dear widow-lady  i feel quite\\r\\nhot  i am quite changed  i begin to unfold myself  you will burn a hole\\r\\nin me  oh  i offer you my hand ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“rag ” said the box-iron  and went proudly over the collar: for she\\r\\nfancied she was a steam-engine  that would go on the railroad and draw\\r\\nthe waggons  “rag ” said the box-iron \\r\\n\\r\\nthe collar was a little jagged at the edge  and so came the long\\r\\nscissors to cut off the jagged part  “oh ” said the collar  “you are\\r\\ncertainly the first opera dancer  how well you can stretch your legs\\r\\nout  it is the most graceful performance i have ever seen  no one can\\r\\nimitate you ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i know it ” said the scissors \\r\\n\\r\\n“you deserve to be a baroness ” said the collar  “all that i have is a\\r\\nfine gentleman  a boot-jack  and a hair-comb  if i only had the barony ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“do you seek my hand?” said the scissors  for she was angry  and without\\r\\nmore ado  she cut him  and then he was condemned \\r\\n\\r\\n“i shall now be obliged to ask the hair-comb  it is surprising how well\\r\\nyou preserve your teeth  miss ” said the collar  “have you never thought\\r\\nof being betrothed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  of course  you may be sure of that ” said the hair-comb  “i am\\r\\nbetrothedto the boot-jack ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“betrothed ” exclaimed the collar  now there was no other to court  and\\r\\nso he despised it \\r\\n\\r\\na long time passed away  then the collar came into the rag chest at the\\r\\npaper mill  there was a large company of rags  the fine by themselves \\r\\nand the coarse by themselves  just as it should be  they all had much to\\r\\nsay  but the collar the most  for he was a real boaster \\r\\n\\r\\n“i have had such an immense number of sweethearts ” said the collar \\r\\n“i could not be in peace  it is true  i was always a fine starched-up\\r\\ngentleman  i had both a boot-jack and a hair-comb  which i never used \\r\\nyou should have seen me then  you should have seen me when i lay down \\r\\ni shall never forget my first loveshe was a girdle  so fine  so soft \\r\\nand so charming  she threw herself into a tub of water for my sake \\r\\nthere was also a widow  who became glowing hot  but i left her standing\\r\\ntill she got black again  there was also the first opera dancer  she\\r\\ngave me that cut which i now go with  she was so ferocious  my\\r\\nown hair-comb was in love with me  she lost all her teeth from the\\r\\nheart-ache  yes  i have lived to see much of that sort of thing  but i\\r\\nam extremely sorry for the garteri mean the girdlethat went into the\\r\\nwater-tub  i have much on my conscience  i want to become white paper ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand it became so  all the rags were turned into white paper  but the\\r\\ncollar came to be just this very piece of white paper we here see \\r\\nand on which the story is printed  and that was because it boasted so\\r\\nterribly afterwards of what had never happened to it  it would be well\\r\\nfor us to beware  that we may not act in a similar manner  for we can\\r\\nnever know if we may not  in the course of time  also come into the\\r\\nrag chest  and be made into white paper  and then have our whole life's\\r\\nhistory printed on it  even the most secret  and be obliged to run about\\r\\nand tell it ourselves  just like this collar \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe shadow\\r\\n\\r\\nit is in the hot lands that the sun burns  sure enough  there the people\\r\\nbecome quite a mahogany brown  ay  and in the hottest lands they are\\r\\nburnt to negroes  but now it was only to the hot lands that a learned\\r\\nman had come from the cold  there he thought that he could run about\\r\\njust as when at home  but he soon found out his mistake \\r\\n\\r\\nhe  and all sensible folks  were obliged to stay within doorsthe\\r\\nwindow-shutters and doors were closed the whole day  it looked as if the\\r\\nwhole house slept  or there was no one at home \\r\\n\\r\\nthe narrow street with the high houses  was built so that the sunshine\\r\\nmust fall there from morning till eveningit was really not to be\\r\\nborne \\r\\n\\r\\nthe learned man from the cold landshe was a young man  and seemed to\\r\\nbe a clever mansat in a glowing oven  it took effect on him  he became\\r\\nquite meagreeven his shadow shrunk in  for the sun had also an effect\\r\\non it  it was first towards evening when the sun was down  that they\\r\\nbegan to freshen up again \\r\\n\\r\\nin the warm lands every window has a balcony  and the people came out on\\r\\nall the balconies in the streetfor one must have air  even if one be\\r\\naccustomed to be mahogany * it was lively both up and down the\\r\\nstreet  tailors  and shoemakers  and all the folks  moved out into the\\r\\nstreetchairs and tables were brought forthand candles burntyes \\r\\nabove a thousand lights were burningand the one talked and the other\\r\\nsung  and people walked and church-bells rang  and asses went along with\\r\\na dingle-dingle-dong  for they too had bells on  the street boys were\\r\\nscreaming and hooting  and shouting and shooting  with devils and\\r\\ndetonating ballsand there came corpse bearers and hood wearersfor\\r\\nthere were funerals with psalm and hymnand then the din of carriages\\r\\ndriving and company arriving: yes  it was  in truth  lively enough down\\r\\nin the street  only in that single house  which stood opposite that in\\r\\nwhich the learned foreigner lived  it was quite still  and yet some one\\r\\nlived there  for there stood flowers in the balconythey grew so\\r\\nwell in the sun's heat  and that they could not do unless they were\\r\\nwateredand some one must water themthere must be somebody there \\r\\nthe door opposite was also opened late in the evening  but it was dark\\r\\nwithin  at least in the front room  further in there was heard the sound\\r\\nof music  the learned foreigner thought it quite marvellous  but nowit\\r\\nmight be that he only imagined itfor he found everything marvellous\\r\\nout there  in the warm lands  if there had only been no sun  the\\r\\nstranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the house\\r\\nopposite  one saw no person about  and as to the music  it appeared\\r\\nto him to be extremely tiresome  “it is as if some one sat there  and\\r\\npractised a piece that he could not masteralways the same piece  'i\\r\\nshall master it ' says he  but yet he cannot master it  however long he\\r\\nplays ”\\r\\n\\r\\n* the word mahogany can be understood  in danish  as having two\\r\\nmeanings  in general  it means the reddish-brown wood itself  but in\\r\\njest  it signifies “excessively fine ” which arose from an anecdote of\\r\\nnyboder  in copenhagen  (the seamen's quarter ) a sailor's wife  who was\\r\\nalways proud and fine  in her way  came to her neighbor  and complained\\r\\nthat she had got a splinter in her finger  “what of?” asked the\\r\\nneighbor's wife  “it is a mahogany splinter ” said the other  “mahogany \\r\\nit cannot be less with you ” exclaimed the womanand thence the\\r\\nproverb  “it is so mahogany ”(that is  so excessively fine)is\\r\\nderived \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\none night the stranger awokehe slept with the doors of the balcony\\r\\nopenthe curtain before it was raised by the wind  and he thought\\r\\nthat a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house  all the\\r\\nflowers shone like flames  in the most beautiful colors  and in the\\r\\nmidst of the flowers stood a slender  graceful maidenit was as if she\\r\\nalso shone  the light really hurt his eyes  he now opened them quite\\r\\nwideyes  he was quite awake  with one spring he was on the floor  he\\r\\ncrept gently behind the curtain  but the maiden was gone  the flowers\\r\\nshone no longer  but there they stood  fresh and blooming as ever \\r\\nthe door was ajar  and  far within  the music sounded so soft and\\r\\ndelightful  one could really melt away in sweet thoughts from it  yet\\r\\nit was like a piece of enchantment  and who lived there? where was the\\r\\nactual entrance? the whole of the ground-floor was a row of shops  and\\r\\nthere people could not always be running through \\r\\n\\r\\none evening the stranger sat out on the balcony  the light burnt in the\\r\\nroom behind him  and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should\\r\\nfall on his opposite neighbor's wall  yes  there it sat  directly\\r\\nopposite  between the flowers on the balcony  and when the stranger\\r\\nmoved  the shadow also moved: for that it always does \\r\\n\\r\\n“i think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there ” said\\r\\nthe learned man  “see  how nicely it sits between the flowers  the door\\r\\nstands half-open: now the shadow should be cunning  and go into the\\r\\nroom  look about  and then come and tell me what it had seen  come  now \\r\\nbe useful  and do me a service ” said he  in jest  “have the kindness to\\r\\nstep in  now  art thou going?” and then he nodded to the shadow  and the\\r\\nshadow nodded again  “well then  go  but don't stay away ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthe stranger rose  and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony\\r\\nrose also  the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned round \\r\\nyes  if anyone had paid particular attention to it  they would have\\r\\nseen  quite distinctly  that the shadow went in through the half-open\\r\\nbalcony-door of their opposite neighbor  just as the stranger went into\\r\\nhis own room  and let the long curtain fall down after him \\r\\n\\r\\nnext morning  the learned man went out to drink coffee and read the\\r\\nnewspapers \\r\\n\\r\\n“what is that?” said he  as he came out into the sunshine  “i have no\\r\\nshadow  so then  it has actually gone last night  and not come again  it\\r\\nis really tiresome ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthis annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone  but because\\r\\nhe knew there was a story about a man without a shadow * it was known\\r\\nto everybody at home  in the cold lands  and if the learned man now came\\r\\nthere and told his story  they would say that he was imitating it  and\\r\\nthat he had no need to do  he would  therefore  not talk about it at\\r\\nall  and that was wisely thought \\r\\n\\r\\n*peter schlemihl  the shadowless man \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nin the evening he went out again on the balcony  he had placed the light\\r\\ndirectly behind him  for he knew that the shadow would always have its\\r\\nmaster for a screen  but he could not entice it  he made himself little \\r\\nhe made himself great: but no shadow came again  he said  “hem  hem ”\\r\\n but it was of no use \\r\\n\\r\\nit was vexatious  but in the warm lands everything grows so quickly  and\\r\\nafter the lapse of eight days he observed  to his great joy  that a new\\r\\nshadow came in the sunshine  in the course of three weeks he had a very\\r\\nfair shadow  which  when he set out for his home in the northern lands \\r\\ngrew more and more in the journey  so that at last it was so long and so\\r\\nlarge  that it was more than sufficient \\r\\n\\r\\nthe learned man then came home  and he wrote books about what was true\\r\\nin the world  and about what was good and what was beautiful  and there\\r\\npassed days and yearsyes  many years passed away \\r\\n\\r\\none evening  as he was sitting in his room  there was a gentle knocking\\r\\nat the door \\r\\n\\r\\n“come in ” said he  but no one came in  so he opened the door  and there\\r\\nstood before him such an extremely lean man  that he felt quite strange \\r\\nas to the rest  the man was very finely dressedhe must be a gentleman \\r\\n\\r\\n“whom have i the honor of speaking?” asked the learned man \\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  i thought as much ” said the fine man  “i thought you would not\\r\\nknow me  i have got so much body  i have even got flesh and clothes  you\\r\\ncertainly never thought of seeing me so well off  do you not know your\\r\\nold shadow? you certainly thought i should never more return  things\\r\\nhave gone on well with me since i was last with you  i have  in all\\r\\nrespects  become very well off  shall i purchase my freedom from\\r\\nservice? if so  i can do it”  and then he rattled a whole bunch of\\r\\nvaluable seals that hung to his watch  and he stuck his hand in the\\r\\nthick gold chain he wore around his necknay  how all his fingers\\r\\nglittered with diamond rings  and then all were pure gems \\r\\n\\r\\n“nay  i cannot recover from my surprise ” said the learned man  “what is\\r\\nthe meaning of all this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“something common  is it not ” said the shadow  “but you yourself do not\\r\\nbelong to the common order  and i  as you know well  have from a child\\r\\nfollowed in your footsteps  as soon as you found i was capable to go\\r\\nout alone in the world  i went my own way  i am in the most brilliant\\r\\ncircumstances  but there came a sort of desire over me to see you once\\r\\nmore before you die  you will die  i suppose? i also wished to see this\\r\\nland againfor you know we always love our native land  i know you have\\r\\ngot another shadow again  have i anything to pay to it or you? if so \\r\\nyou will oblige me by saying what it is ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“nay  is it really thou?” said the learned man  “it is most remarkable:\\r\\ni never imagined that one's old shadow could come again as a man ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“tell me what i have to pay ” said the shadow  “for i don't like to be\\r\\nin any sort of debt ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“how canst thou talk so?” said the learned man  “what debt is there to\\r\\ntalk about? make thyself as free as anyone else  i am extremely glad to\\r\\nhear of thy good fortune: sit down  old friend  and tell me a little\\r\\nhow it has gone with thee  and what thou hast seen at our opposite\\r\\nneighbor's therein the warm lands ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  i will tell you all about it ” said the shadow  and sat down: “but\\r\\nthen you must also promise me  that  wherever you may meet me  you will\\r\\nnever say to anyone here in the town that i have been your shadow  i\\r\\nintend to get betrothed  for i can provide for more than one family ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“be quite at thy ease about that ” said the learned man  “i shall not\\r\\nsay to anyone who thou actually art: here is my handi promise it  and\\r\\na man's bond is his word ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“a word is a shadow ” said the shadow  “and as such it must speak ”\\r\\n\\r\\nit was really quite astonishing how much of a man it was  it was dressed\\r\\nentirely in black  and of the very finest cloth  it had patent leather\\r\\nboots  and a hat that could be folded together  so that it was bare\\r\\ncrown and brim  not to speak of what we already know it hadseals  gold\\r\\nneck-chain  and diamond rings  yes  the shadow was well-dressed  and it\\r\\nwas just that which made it quite a man \\r\\n\\r\\n“now i shall tell you my adventures ” said the shadow  and then he\\r\\nsat  with the polished boots  as heavily as he could  on the arm of the\\r\\nlearned man's new shadow  which lay like a poodle-dog at his feet \\r\\nnow this was perhaps from arrogance  and the shadow on the ground kept\\r\\nitself so still and quiet  that it might hear all that passed: it wished\\r\\nto know how it could get free  and work its way up  so as to become its\\r\\nown master \\r\\n\\r\\n“do you know who lived in our opposite neighbor's house?” said the\\r\\nshadow  “it was the most charming of all beings  it was poesy  i was\\r\\nthere for three weeks  and that has as much effect as if one had lived\\r\\nthree thousand years  and read all that was composed and written \\r\\nthat is what i say  and it is right  i have seen everything and i know\\r\\neverything ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“poesy ” cried the learned man  “yes  yes  she often dwells a recluse\\r\\nin large cities  poesy  yes  i have seen hera single short moment \\r\\nbut sleep came into my eyes  she stood on the balcony and shone as the\\r\\naurora borealis shines  go on  go onthou wert on the balcony  and went\\r\\nthrough the doorway  and then”\\r\\n\\r\\n“then i was in the antechamber ” said the shadow  “you always sat and\\r\\nlooked over to the antechamber  there was no light  there was a sort\\r\\nof twilight  but the one door stood open directly opposite the other\\r\\nthrough a long row of rooms and saloons  and there it was lighted up  i\\r\\nshould have been completely killed if i had gone over to the maiden  but\\r\\ni was circumspect  i took time to think  and that one must always do ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“and what didst thou then see?” asked the learned man \\r\\n\\r\\n“i saw everything  and i shall tell all to you: butit is no pride on\\r\\nmy partas a free man  and with the knowledge i have  not to speak of\\r\\nmy position in life  my excellent circumstancesi certainly wish that\\r\\nyou would say you* to me ”\\r\\n\\r\\n* it is the custom in denmark for intimate acquaintances to use the\\r\\nsecond person singular  “du ” (thou) when speaking to each other  when\\r\\na friendship is formed between men  they generally affirm it  when\\r\\noccasion offers  either in public or private  by drinking to each other\\r\\nand exclaiming  “thy health ” at the same time striking their glasses\\r\\ntogether  this is called drinking “duus”: they are then  “duus brodre ”\\r\\n (thou brothers) and ever afterwards use the pronoun “thou ” to each\\r\\nother  it being regarded as more familiar than “de ” (you)  father and\\r\\nmother  sister and brother say thou to one anotherwithout regard to\\r\\nage or rank  master and mistress say thou to their servants the superior\\r\\nto the inferior  but servants and inferiors do not use the same term\\r\\nto their masters  or superiorsnor is it ever used when speaking to a\\r\\nstranger  or anyone with whom they are but slightly acquaintedthey\\r\\nthen say as in englishyou \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“i beg your pardon ” said the learned man  “it is an old habit with me \\r\\nyou are perfectly right  and i shall remember it  but now you must tell\\r\\nme all you saw ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“everything ” said the shadow  “for i saw everything  and i know\\r\\neverything ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“how did it look in the furthest saloon?” asked the learned man  “was it\\r\\nthere as in the fresh woods? was it there as in a holy church? were the\\r\\nsaloons like the starlit firmament when we stand on the high mountains?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“everything was there ” said the shadow  “i did not go quite in  i\\r\\nremained in the foremost room  in the twilight  but i stood there\\r\\nquite well  i saw everything  and i know everything  i have been in the\\r\\nantechamber at the court of poesy ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“but what did you see? did all the gods of the olden times pass through\\r\\nthe large saloons? did the old heroes combat there? did sweet children\\r\\nplay there  and relate their dreams?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i tell you i was there  and you can conceive that i saw everything\\r\\nthere was to be seen  had you come over there  you would not have been\\r\\na man  but i became so  and besides  i learned to know my inward nature \\r\\nmy innate qualities  the relationship i had with poesy  at the time i\\r\\nwas with you  i thought not of that  but alwaysyou know it wellwhen\\r\\nthe sun rose  and when the sun went down  i became so strangely great \\r\\nin the moonlight i was very near being more distinct than yourself  at\\r\\nthat time i did not understand my nature  it was revealed to me in the\\r\\nantechamber  i became a man  i came out matured  but you were no longer\\r\\nin the warm lands  as a man i was ashamed to go as i did  i was in\\r\\nwant of boots  of clothes  of the whole human varnish that makes a man\\r\\nperceptible  i took my wayi tell it to you  but you will not put it in\\r\\nany booki took my way to the cake womani hid myself behind her \\r\\nthe woman didn't think how much she concealed  i went out first in the\\r\\nevening  i ran about the streets in the moonlight  i made myself long up\\r\\nthe wallsit tickles the back so delightfully  i ran up  and ran down \\r\\npeeped into the highest windows  into the saloons  and on the roofs  i\\r\\npeeped in where no one could peep  and i saw what no one else saw  what\\r\\nno one else should see  this is  in fact  a base world  i would not be a\\r\\nman if it were not now once accepted and regarded as something to be so \\r\\ni saw the most unimaginable things with the women  with the men  with\\r\\nparents  and with the sweet  matchless children  i saw ” said the\\r\\nshadow  “what no human being must know  but what they would all\\r\\nso willingly knowwhat is bad in their neighbor  had i written a\\r\\nnewspaper  it would have been read  but i wrote direct to the persons\\r\\nthemselves  and there was consternation in all the towns where i came \\r\\nthey were so afraid of me  and yet they were so excessively fond of\\r\\nme  the professors made a professor of me  the tailors gave me new\\r\\nclothesi am well furnished  the master of the mint struck new coin for\\r\\nme  and the women said i was so handsome  and so i became the man i am \\r\\nand i now bid you farewell  here is my cardi live on the sunny side\\r\\nof the street  and am always at home in rainy weather ” and so away went\\r\\nthe shadow  “that was most extraordinary ” said the learned man  years\\r\\nand days passed away  then the shadow came again  “how goes it?” said\\r\\nthe shadow \\r\\n\\r\\n“alas ” said the learned man  “i write about the true  and the good \\r\\nand the beautiful  but no one cares to hear such things  i am quite\\r\\ndesperate  for i take it so much to heart ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“but i don't ” said the shadow  “i become fat  and it is that one wants\\r\\nto become  you do not understand the world  you will become ill by it \\r\\nyou must travel  i shall make a tour this summer  will you go with me?\\r\\ni should like to have a travelling companion  will you go with me  as\\r\\nshadow? it will be a great pleasure for me to have you with me  i shall\\r\\npay the travelling expenses ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“nay  this is too much ” said the learned man \\r\\n\\r\\n“it is just as one takes it ” said the shadow  “it will do you much good\\r\\nto travel  will you be my shadow? you shall have everything free on the\\r\\njourney ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“nay  that is too bad ” said the learned man \\r\\n\\r\\n“but it is just so with the world ” said the shadow  “and so it will\\r\\nbe ” and away it went again \\r\\n\\r\\nthe learned man was not at all in the most enviable state  grief and\\r\\ntorment followed him  and what he said about the true  and the good  and\\r\\nthe beautiful  was  to most persons  like roses for a cow  he was quite\\r\\nill at last \\r\\n\\r\\n“you really look like a shadow ” said his friends to him  and the\\r\\nlearned man trembled  for he thought of it \\r\\n\\r\\n“you must go to a watering-place ” said the shadow  who came and visited\\r\\nhim  “there is nothing else for it  i will take you with me for old\\r\\nacquaintance' sake  i will pay the travelling expenses  and you write\\r\\nthe descriptionsand if they are a little amusing for me on the way \\r\\ni will go to a watering-placemy beard does not grow out as it\\r\\noughtthat is also a sicknessand one must have a beard  now you be\\r\\nwise and accept the offer  we shall travel as comrades ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand so they travelled  the shadow was master  and the master was the\\r\\nshadow  they drove with each other  they rode and walked together  side\\r\\nby side  before and behind  just as the sun was  the shadow always took\\r\\ncare to keep itself in the master's place  now the learned man didn't\\r\\nthink much about that  he was a very kind-hearted man  and particularly\\r\\nmild and friendly  and so he said one day to the shadow: “as we have\\r\\nnow become companions  and in this way have grown up together from\\r\\nchildhood  shall we not drink 'thou' together  it is more familiar?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“you are right ” said the shadow  who was now the proper master  “it is\\r\\nsaid in a very straight-forward and well-meant manner  you  as a learned\\r\\nman  certainly know how strange nature is  some persons cannot bear to\\r\\ntouch grey paper  or they become ill  others shiver in every limb if one\\r\\nrub a pane of glass with a nail: i have just such a feeling on hearing\\r\\nyou say thou to me  i feel myself as if pressed to the earth in my first\\r\\nsituation with you  you see that it is a feeling  that it is not pride:\\r\\ni cannot allow you to say thou to me  but i will willingly say thou to\\r\\nyou  so it is half done ”\\r\\n\\r\\nso the shadow said thou to its former master \\r\\n\\r\\n“this is rather too bad ” thought he  “that i must say you and he say\\r\\nthou ” but he was now obliged to put up with it \\r\\n\\r\\nso they came to a watering-place where there were many strangers  and\\r\\namongst them was a princess  who was troubled with seeing too well  and\\r\\nthat was so alarming \\r\\n\\r\\nshe directly observed that the stranger who had just come was quite a\\r\\ndifferent sort of person to all the others  “he has come here in order\\r\\nto get his beard to grow  they say  but i see the real cause  he cannot\\r\\ncast a shadow ”\\r\\n\\r\\nshe had become inquisitive  and so she entered into conversation\\r\\ndirectly with the strange gentleman  on their promenades  as the\\r\\ndaughter of a king  she needed not to stand upon trifles  so she said \\r\\n“your complaint is  that you cannot cast a shadow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“your royal highness must be improving considerably ” said the shadow \\r\\n“i know your complaint is  that you see too clearly  but it has\\r\\ndecreased  you are cured  i just happen to have a very unusual shadow \\r\\ndo you not see that person who always goes with me? other persons have\\r\\na common shadow  but i do not like what is common to all  we give our\\r\\nservants finer cloth for their livery than we ourselves use  and so i\\r\\nhad my shadow trimmed up into a man: yes  you see i have even given him\\r\\na shadow  it is somewhat expensive  but i like to have something for\\r\\nmyself ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“what ” thought the princess  “should i really be cured  these baths are\\r\\nthe first in the world  in our time water has wonderful powers  but i\\r\\nshall not leave the place  for it now begins to be amusing here  i am\\r\\nextremely fond of that stranger: would that his beard should not grow \\r\\nfor in that case he will leave us ”\\r\\n\\r\\nin the evening  the princess and the shadow danced together in the large\\r\\nball-room  she was light  but he was still lighter  she had never had\\r\\nsuch a partner in the dance  she told him from what land she came  and\\r\\nhe knew that land  he had been there  but then she was not at home  he\\r\\nhad peeped in at the window  above and belowhe had seen both the\\r\\none and the other  and so he could answer the princess  and make\\r\\ninsinuations  so that she was quite astonished  he must be the wisest\\r\\nman in the whole world  she felt such respect for what he knew  so that\\r\\nwhen they again danced together she fell in love with him  and that the\\r\\nshadow could remark  for she almost pierced him through with her eyes \\r\\nso they danced once more together  and she was about to declare herself \\r\\nbut she was discreet  she thought of her country and kingdom  and of the\\r\\nmany persons she would have to reign over \\r\\n\\r\\n“he is a wise man ” said she to herself“it is well  and he dances\\r\\ndelightfullythat is also good  but has he solid knowledge? that is\\r\\njust as important  he must be examined ”\\r\\n\\r\\nso she began  by degrees  to question him about the most difficult\\r\\nthings she could think of  and which she herself could not have\\r\\nanswered  so that the shadow made a strange face \\r\\n\\r\\n“you cannot answer these questions?” said the princess \\r\\n\\r\\n“they belong to my childhood's learning ” said the shadow  “i really\\r\\nbelieve my shadow  by the door there  can answer them ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“your shadow ” said the princess  “that would indeed be marvellous ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i will not say for a certainty that he can ” said the shadow  “but i\\r\\nthink so  he has now followed me for so many years  and listened to my\\r\\nconversationi should think it possible  but your royal highness will\\r\\npermit me to observe  that he is so proud of passing himself off for\\r\\na man  that when he is to be in a proper humorand he must be so to\\r\\nanswer wellhe must be treated quite like a man ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“oh  i like that ” said the princess \\r\\n\\r\\nso she went to the learned man by the door  and she spoke to him about\\r\\nthe sun and the moon  and about persons out of and in the world  and he\\r\\nanswered with wisdom and prudence \\r\\n\\r\\n“what a man that must be who has so wise a shadow ” thought she  “it\\r\\nwill be a real blessing to my people and kingdom if i choose him for my\\r\\nconsorti will do it ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthey were soon agreed  both the princess and the shadow  but no one was\\r\\nto know about it before she arrived in her own kingdom \\r\\n\\r\\n“no onenot even my shadow ” said the shadow  and he had his own\\r\\nthoughts about it \\r\\n\\r\\nnow they were in the country where the princess reigned when she was at\\r\\nhome \\r\\n\\r\\n“listen  my good friend ” said the shadow to the learned man  “i have\\r\\nnow become as happy and mighty as anyone can be  i will  therefore  do\\r\\nsomething particular for thee  thou shalt always live with me in the\\r\\npalace  drive with me in my royal carriage  and have ten thousand\\r\\npounds a year  but then thou must submit to be called shadow by all and\\r\\neveryone  thou must not say that thou hast ever been a man  and once\\r\\na year  when i sit on the balcony in the sunshine  thou must lie at my\\r\\nfeet  as a shadow shall do  i must tell thee: i am going to marry the\\r\\nking's daughter  and the nuptials are to take place this evening ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“nay  this is going too far ” said the learned man  “i will not have it \\r\\ni will not do it  it is to deceive the whole country and the princess\\r\\ntoo  i will tell everything  that i am a man  and that thou art a\\r\\nshadowthou art only dressed up ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“there is no one who will believe it ” said the shadow  “be reasonable \\r\\nor i will call the guard ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i will go directly to the princess ” said the learned man \\r\\n\\r\\n“but i will go first ” said the shadow  “and thou wilt go to prison ”\\r\\n and that he was obliged to dofor the sentinels obeyed him whom they\\r\\nknew the king's daughter was to marry \\r\\n\\r\\n“you tremble ” said the princess  as the shadow came into her chamber \\r\\n“has anything happened? you must not be unwell this evening  now that we\\r\\nare to have our nuptials celebrated ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“i have lived to see the most cruel thing that anyone can live to\\r\\nsee ” said the shadow  “only imagineyes  it is true  such a poor\\r\\nshadow-skull cannot bear muchonly think  my shadow has become mad \\r\\nhe thinks that he is a man  and that inow only thinkthat i am his\\r\\nshadow ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“it is terrible ” said the princess  “but he is confined  is he not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“that he is  i am afraid that he will never recover ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“poor shadow ” said the princess  “he is very unfortunate  it would be\\r\\na real work of charity to deliver him from the little life he has  and \\r\\nwhen i think properly over the matter  i am of opinion that it will be\\r\\nnecessary to do away with him in all stillness ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“it is certainly hard ” said the shadow  “for he was a faithful\\r\\nservant ” and then he gave a sort of sigh \\r\\n\\r\\n“you are a noble character ” said the princess \\r\\n\\r\\nthe whole city was illuminated in the evening  and the cannons went off\\r\\nwith a bum  bum  and the soldiers presented arms  that was a marriage \\r\\nthe princess and the shadow went out on the balcony to show themselves \\r\\nand get another hurrah \\r\\n\\r\\nthe learned man heard nothing of all thisfor they had deprived him of\\r\\nlife \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe little match girl\\r\\n\\r\\nmost terribly cold it was  it snowed  and was nearly quite dark  and\\r\\neveningthe last evening of the year  in this cold and darkness there\\r\\nwent along the street a poor little girl  bareheaded  and with naked\\r\\nfeet  when she left home she had slippers on  it is true  but what was\\r\\nthe good of that? they were very large slippers  which her mother had\\r\\nhitherto worn  so large were they  and the poor little thing lost them\\r\\nas she scuffled away across the street  because of two carriages that\\r\\nrolled by dreadfully fast \\r\\n\\r\\none slipper was nowhere to be found  the other had been laid hold of by\\r\\nan urchin  and off he ran with it  he thought it would do capitally for\\r\\na cradle when he some day or other should have children himself  so the\\r\\nlittle maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet  that were quite red\\r\\nand blue from cold  she carried a quantity of matches in an old apron \\r\\nand she held a bundle of them in her hand  nobody had bought anything of\\r\\nher the whole livelong day  no one had given her a single farthing \\r\\n\\r\\nshe crept along trembling with cold and hungera very picture of\\r\\nsorrow  the poor little thing \\r\\n\\r\\nthe flakes of snow covered her long fair hair  which fell in beautiful\\r\\ncurls around her neck  but of that  of course  she never once now\\r\\nthought  from all the windows the candles were gleaming  and it smelt so\\r\\ndeliciously of roast goose  for you know it was new year's eve  yes  of\\r\\nthat she thought \\r\\n\\r\\nin a corner formed by two houses  of which one advanced more than the\\r\\nother  she seated herself down and cowered together  her little feet\\r\\nshe had drawn close up to her  but she grew colder and colder  and to go\\r\\nhome she did not venture  for she had not sold any matches and could\\r\\nnot bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get\\r\\nblows  and at home it was cold too  for above her she had only the roof \\r\\nthrough which the wind whistled  even though the largest cracks were\\r\\nstopped up with straw and rags \\r\\n\\r\\nher little hands were almost numbed with cold  oh  a match might afford\\r\\nher a world of comfort  if she only dared take a single one out of the\\r\\nbundle  draw it against the wall  and warm her fingers by it  she drew\\r\\none out  “rischt ” how it blazed  how it burnt  it was a warm  bright\\r\\nflame  like a candle  as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful\\r\\nlight  it seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting\\r\\nbefore a large iron stove  with burnished brass feet and a brass\\r\\nornament at top  the fire burned with such blessed influence  it warmed\\r\\nso delightfully  the little girl had already stretched out her feet to\\r\\nwarm them too  butthe small flame went out  the stove vanished: she\\r\\nhad only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand \\r\\n\\r\\nshe rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly  and where the\\r\\nlight fell on the wall  there the wall became transparent like a\\r\\nveil  so that she could see into the room  on the table was spread a\\r\\nsnow-white tablecloth  upon it was a splendid porcelain service  and the\\r\\nroast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried\\r\\nplums  and what was still more capital to behold was  the goose hopped\\r\\ndown from the dish  reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its\\r\\nbreast  till it came up to the poor little girl  whenthe match went\\r\\nout and nothing but the thick  cold  damp wall was left behind \\r\\nshe lighted another match  now there she was sitting under the most\\r\\nmagnificent christmas tree: it was still larger  and more decorated than\\r\\nthe one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's\\r\\nhouse \\r\\n\\r\\nthousands of lights were burning on the green branches  and\\r\\ngaily-colored pictures  such as she had seen in the shop-windows  looked\\r\\ndown upon her  the little maiden stretched out her hands towards them\\r\\nwhenthe match went out  the lights of the christmas tree rose higher\\r\\nand higher  she saw them now as stars in heaven  one fell down and\\r\\nformed a long trail of fire \\r\\n\\r\\n“someone is just dead ” said the little girl  for her old grandmother \\r\\nthe only person who had loved her  and who was now no more  had told\\r\\nher  that when a star falls  a soul ascends to god \\r\\n\\r\\nshe drew another match against the wall: it was again light  and in the\\r\\nlustre there stood the old grandmother  so bright and radiant  so mild \\r\\nand with such an expression of love \\r\\n\\r\\n“grandmother ” cried the little one  “oh  take me with you  you go\\r\\naway when the match burns out  you vanish like the warm stove  like the\\r\\ndelicious roast goose  and like the magnificent christmas tree ” and\\r\\nshe rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall  for\\r\\nshe wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her  and\\r\\nthe matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at\\r\\nnoon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and\\r\\nso tall  she took the little maiden  on her arm  and both flew in\\r\\nbrightness and in joy so high  so very high  and then above was neither\\r\\ncold  nor hunger  nor anxietythey were with god \\r\\n\\r\\nbut in the corner  at the cold hour of dawn  sat the poor girl  with\\r\\nrosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth  leaning against the wallfrozen\\r\\nto death on the last evening of the old year  stiff and stark sat the\\r\\nchild there with her matches  of which one bundle had been burnt  “she\\r\\nwanted to warm herself ” people said  no one had the slightest suspicion\\r\\nof what beautiful things she had seen  no one even dreamed of the\\r\\nsplendor in which  with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a\\r\\nnew year \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe dream of little tuk\\r\\n\\r\\nah  yes  that was little tuk: in reality his name was not tuk  but that\\r\\nwas what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for\\r\\ncharles  and it is all well enough if one does but know it  he had now\\r\\nto take care of his little sister augusta  who was much younger than\\r\\nhimself  and he was  besides  to learn his lesson at the same time  but\\r\\nthese two things would not do together at all  there sat the poor little\\r\\nfellow  with his sister on his lap  and he sang to her all the songs he\\r\\nknew  and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book\\r\\nthat lay open before him  by the next morning he was to have learnt\\r\\nall the towns in zealand by heart  and to know about them all that is\\r\\npossible to be known \\r\\n\\r\\nhis mother now came home  for she had been out  and took little augusta\\r\\non her arm  tuk ran quickly to the window  and read so eagerly that he\\r\\npretty nearly read his eyes out  for it got darker and darker  but his\\r\\nmother had no money to buy a candle \\r\\n\\r\\n“there goes the old washerwoman over the way ” said his mother  as she\\r\\nlooked out of the window  “the poor woman can hardly drag herself along \\r\\nand she must now drag the pail home from the fountain  be a good boy \\r\\ntukey  and run across and help the old woman  won't you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nso tuk ran over quickly and helped her  but when he came back again into\\r\\nthe room it was quite dark  and as to a light  there was no thought of\\r\\nsuch a thing  he was now to go to bed  that was an old turn-up bedstead \\r\\nin it he lay and thought about his geography lesson  and of zealand  and\\r\\nof all that his master had told him  he ought  to be sure  to have read\\r\\nover his lesson again  but that  you know  he could not do  he therefore\\r\\nput his geography-book under his pillow  because he had heard that was\\r\\na very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson  but one\\r\\ncannot  however  rely upon it entirely  well  there he lay  and thought\\r\\nand thought  and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes\\r\\nand mouth: he slept  and yet he did not sleep  it was as though the old\\r\\nwasherwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said  “it were a great\\r\\nsin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning  you have aided\\r\\nme  i therefore will now help you  and the loving god will do so at all\\r\\ntimes ” and all of a sudden the book under tuk's pillow began scraping\\r\\nand scratching \\r\\n\\r\\n“kickery-ki  kluk  kluk  kluk ”that was an old hen who came creeping\\r\\nalong  and she was from kjoge  “i am a kjoger hen ” [*] said she  and then\\r\\nshe related how many inhabitants there were there  and about the battle\\r\\nthat had taken place  and which  after all  was hardly worth talking\\r\\nabout \\r\\n\\r\\n     * kjoge  a town in the bay of kjoge  “to see the kjoge\\r\\n     hens ” is an expression similar to “showing a child london ”\\r\\n      which is said to be

sojourned during his stay in denmark  and where he called many\\r\\nof his immortal works into existence \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbut little tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on\\r\\nhorseback  on he went at full gallop  still galloping on and on  a\\r\\nknight with a gleaming plume  and most magnificently dressed  held him\\r\\nbefore him on the horse  and thus they rode through the wood to the old\\r\\ntown of bordingborg  and that was a large and very lively town  high\\r\\ntowers rose from the castle of the king  and the brightness of many\\r\\ncandles streamed from all the windows  within was dance and song \\r\\nand king waldemar and the young  richly-attired maids of honor danced\\r\\ntogether  the morn now came  and as soon as the sun appeared  the whole\\r\\ntown and the king's palace crumbled together  and one tower after the\\r\\nother  and at last only a single one remained standing where the castle\\r\\nhad been before * and the town was so small and poor  and the school\\r\\nboys came along with their books under their arms  and said  “2000\\r\\ninhabitants ” but that was not true  for there were not so many \\r\\n\\r\\n*bordingborg  in the reign of king waldemar  a considerable place  now\\r\\nan unimportant little town  one solitary tower only  and some remains of\\r\\na wall  show where the castle once stood \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nand little tukey lay in his bed: it seemed to him as if he dreamed  and\\r\\nyet as if he were not dreaming  however  somebody was close beside him \\r\\n\\r\\n“little tukey  little tukey ” cried someone near  it was a

\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nlittle tuk looked  and all was red and green before his eyes  but as\\r\\nsoon as the confusion of colors was somewhat over  all of a sudden there\\r\\nappeared a wooded slope close to the bay  and high up above stood a\\r\\nmagnificent old church  with two high pointed towers  from out the\\r\\nhill-side spouted fountains in thick streams of water  so that there\\r\\nwas a continual splashing  and close beside them sat an old king with\\r\\na golden crown upon his white head: that was king hroar  near the\\r\\nfountains  close to the town of roeskilde  as it is now called  and up\\r\\nthe slope into the old church went all the kings and queens of denmark \\r\\nhand in hand  all with their golden crowns  and the organ played and\\r\\nthe fountains rustled  little

\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nagain all suddenly disappeared  yes  and whither? it seemed to him\\r\\njust as if one turned over a leaf in a book  and now stood there an\\r\\nold peasant-woman  who came from soroe * where grass grows in the\\r\\nmarket-place  she had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and\\r\\nback: it was so wet  it certainly must have been raining  “yes  that it\\r\\nhas ” said she  and she now related many pretty things out of holberg's\\r\\ncomedies  and about waldemar and absalon  but all at once she cowered\\r\\ntogether  and her head began shaking backwards and forwards  and she\\r\\nlooked as she were going to make a spring  “croak  croak ” said she \\r\\n“it is wet  it is wet  there is such a pleasant deathlike stillness in\\r\\nsorbe ” she was now suddenly a frog  “croak”  and now she was an old\\r\\nwoman  “one must dress according to the weather ” said she  “it is wet \\r\\nit is wet  my town is just like a bottle  and one gets in by the neck \\r\\nand by the neck one must get out again  in former times i had the\\r\\nfinest fish  and now i have fresh rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the\\r\\nbottle  who learn wisdom  hebrew  greekcroak ”\\r\\n\\r\\n* sorbe  a very quiet little town  beautifully situated  surrounded by\\r\\nwoods and lakes  holberg  denmark's moliere  founded here an academy\\r\\nfor the sons of the nobles  the poets hauch and ingemann were appointed\\r\\nprofessors here  the latter lives there still \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen she spoke it sounded just like the noise of frogs  or as if one\\r\\nwalked with great boots over a moor  always the same tone  so uniform\\r\\nand so tiring that little tuk fell into a good sound sleep  which  by\\r\\nthe bye  could not do him any harm \\r\\n\\r\\nbut even in this sleep there came a dream  or whatever else it was: his\\r\\nlittle sister augusta  she with the blue eyes and the fair curling hair \\r\\nwas suddenly a tall  beautiful girl  and without having wings was yet\\r\\nable to fly  and she now flew over zealandover the green woods and the\\r\\nblue lakes \\r\\n\\r\\n“do you hear the cock crow  tukey? cock-a-doodle-doo  the cocks are\\r\\nflying up from

exalt itself\\r\\nlike king waldemar's tower  and will be richly decorated with marble\\r\\nstatues  like that at prastoe  you understand what i mean  your name\\r\\nshall circulate with renown all round the earth  like unto the ship that\\r\\nwas to have sailed from corsor  and in roeskilde”\\r\\n\\r\\n“do not forget the diet ” said king hroar \\r\\n\\r\\n“then you will speak well and wisely  little tukey  and when at last you\\r\\nsink into your grave  you shall sleep as quietly”\\r\\n\\r\\n“as if i lay in soroe ” said tuk  awaking  it was bright day  and he was\\r\\nnow quite unable to call to mind his dream  that  however  was not at\\r\\nall necessary  for one may not know what the future will bring \\r\\n\\r\\nand out of bed he jumped  and read in his book  and now all at once he\\r\\nknew his whole lesson  and the old washerwoman popped her head in at the\\r\\ndoor  nodded to him friendly  and said  “thanks  many thanks  my good\\r\\nchild  for your help  may the good ever-loving god fulfil your loveliest\\r\\ndream ”\\r\\n\\r\\nlittle tukey did not at all know what he had dreamed  but the loving god\\r\\nknew it \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe naughty boy\\r\\n\\r\\nalong time ago  there lived an old poet  a thoroughly kind old poet  as\\r\\nhe was sitting one evening in his room  a dreadful storm arose without \\r\\nand the rain streamed down from heaven  but the old poet sat warm\\r\\nand comfortable in his chimney-corner  where the fire blazed and the\\r\\nroasting apple hissed \\r\\n\\r\\n“those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the skin ”\\r\\n said the good old poet \\r\\n\\r\\n“oh let me in  let me in  i am cold  and i'm so wet ” exclaimed suddenly\\r\\na child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance  while\\r\\nthe rain poured down  and the wind made all the windows rattle \\r\\n\\r\\n“poor thing ” said the old poet  as he went to open the door  there\\r\\nstood a little boy  quite naked  and the water ran down from his long\\r\\ngolden hair  he trembled with cold  and had he not come into a warm room\\r\\nhe would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest \\r\\n\\r\\n“poor child ” said the old poet  as he took the boy by the hand  “come\\r\\nin  come in  and i will soon restore thee  thou shalt have wine and\\r\\nroasted apples  for thou art verily a charming child ” and the boy was\\r\\nso really  his eyes were like two bright stars  and although the water\\r\\ntrickled down his hair  it waved in beautiful curls  he looked exactly\\r\\nlike a little angel  but he was so pale  and his whole body trembled\\r\\nwith cold  he had a nice little bow in his hand  but it was quite\\r\\nspoiled by the rain  and the tints of his many-colored arrows ran one\\r\\ninto the other \\r\\n\\r\\nthe old poet seated himself beside his hearth  and took the little\\r\\nfellow on his lap  he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair \\r\\nwarmed his hands between his own  and boiled for him some sweet wine \\r\\nthen the boy recovered  his cheeks again grew rosy  he jumped down from\\r\\nthe lap where he was sitting  and danced round the kind old poet \\r\\n\\r\\n“you are a merry fellow ” said the old man  “what's your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“my name is cupid ” answered the boy  “don't you know me? there lies my\\r\\nbow  it shoots well  i can assure you  look  the weather is now clearing\\r\\nup  and the moon is shining clear again through the window ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“why  your bow is quite spoiled ” said the old poet \\r\\n\\r\\n“that were sad indeed ” said the boy  and he took the bow in his hand\\r\\nand examined it on every side  “oh  it is dry again  and is not hurt at\\r\\nall  the string is quite tight  i will try it directly ” and he bent his\\r\\nbow  took aim  and shot an arrow at the old poet  right into his heart \\r\\n“you see now that my bow was not spoiled ” said he laughing  and away he\\r\\nran \\r\\n\\r\\nthe naughty boy  to shoot the old poet in that way  he who had taken him\\r\\ninto his warm room  who had treated him so kindly  and who had given him\\r\\nwarm wine and the very best apples \\r\\n\\r\\nthe poor poet lay on the earth and wept  for the arrow had really flown\\r\\ninto his heart \\r\\n\\r\\n“fie ” said he  “how naughty a boy cupid is  i will tell all children\\r\\nabout him  that they may take care and not play with him  for he will\\r\\nonly cause them sorrow and many a heartache ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand all good children to whom he related this story  took great heed\\r\\nof this naughty cupid  but he made fools of them still  for he is\\r\\nastonishingly cunning  when the university students come from the\\r\\nlectures  he runs beside them in a black coat  and with a book under his\\r\\narm  it is quite impossible for them to know him  and they walk along\\r\\nwith him arm in arm  as if he  too  were a student like themselves  and\\r\\nthen  unperceived  he thrusts an arrow to their bosom  when the young\\r\\nmaidens come from being examined by the clergyman  or go to church to\\r\\nbe confirmed  there he is again close behind them  yes  he is forever\\r\\nfollowing people  at the play  he sits in the great chandelier and burns\\r\\nin bright flames  so that people think it is really a flame  but they\\r\\nsoon discover it is something else  he roves about in the garden of the\\r\\npalace and upon the ramparts: yes  once he even shot your father and\\r\\nmother right in the heart  ask them only and you will hear what they'll\\r\\ntell you  oh  he is a naughty boy  that cupid  you must never have\\r\\nanything to do with him  he is forever running after everybody  only\\r\\nthink  he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother  but that is a\\r\\nlong time ago  and it is all past now  however  a thing of that sort she\\r\\nnever forgets  fie  naughty cupid  but now you know him  and you know \\r\\ntoo  how ill-behaved he is \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthe red shoes\\r\\n\\r\\nthere was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate  but in\\r\\nsummer she was forced to run about with bare feet  she was so poor  and\\r\\nin winter wear very large wooden shoes  which made her little insteps\\r\\nquite red  and that looked so dangerous \\r\\n\\r\\nin the middle of the village lived old dame shoemaker  she sat and sewed\\r\\ntogether  as well as she could  a little pair of shoes out of old red\\r\\nstrips of cloth  they were very clumsy  but it was a kind thought  they\\r\\nwere meant for the little girl  the little girl was called karen \\r\\n\\r\\non the very day her mother was buried  karen received the red shoes \\r\\nand wore them for the first time  they were certainly not intended for\\r\\nmourning  but she had no others  and with stockingless feet she followed\\r\\nthe poor straw coffin in them \\r\\n\\r\\nsuddenly a large old carriage drove up  and a large old lady sat in it:\\r\\nshe looked at the little girl  felt compassion for her  and then said to\\r\\nthe clergyman:\\r\\n\\r\\n“here  give me the little girl  i will adopt her ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes  but\\r\\nthe old lady thought they were horrible  and they were burnt  but karen\\r\\nherself was cleanly and nicely dressed  she must learn to read and sew \\r\\nand people said she was a nice little thing  but the looking-glass said:\\r\\n“thou art more than nice  thou art beautiful ”\\r\\n\\r\\nnow the queen once travelled through the land  and she had her little\\r\\ndaughter with her  and this little daughter was a princess  and people\\r\\nstreamed to the castle  and karen was there also  and the little\\r\\nprincess stood in her fine white dress  in a window  and let herself be\\r\\nstared at  she had neither a train nor a golden crown  but splendid\\r\\nred morocco shoes  they were certainly far handsomer than those dame\\r\\nshoemaker had made for little karen  nothing in the world can be\\r\\ncompared with red shoes \\r\\n\\r\\nnow karen was old enough to be confirmed  she had new clothes and was to\\r\\nhave new shoes also  the rich shoemaker in the city took the measure of\\r\\nher little foot  this took place at his house  in his room  where stood\\r\\nlarge glass-cases  filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots  all\\r\\nthis looked charming  but the old lady could not see well  and so had\\r\\nno pleasure in them  in the midst of the shoes stood a pair of red ones \\r\\njust like those the princess had worn  how beautiful they were  the\\r\\nshoemaker said also they had been made for the child of a count  but had\\r\\nnot fitted \\r\\n\\r\\n“that must be patent leather ” said the old lady  “they shine so ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“yes  they shine ” said karen  and they fitted  and were bought  but the\\r\\nold lady knew nothing about their being red  else she would never have\\r\\nallowed karen to have gone in red shoes to be confirmed  yet such was\\r\\nthe case \\r\\n\\r\\neverybody looked at her feet  and when she stepped through the chancel\\r\\ndoor on the church pavement  it seemed to her as if the old figures on\\r\\nthe tombs  those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives  with\\r\\nstiff ruffs  and long black dresses  fixed their eyes on her red shoes \\r\\nand she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand upon her\\r\\nhead  and spoke of the holy baptism  of the covenant with god  and how\\r\\nshe should be now a matured christian  and the organ pealed so solemnly \\r\\nthe sweet children's voices sang  and the old music-directors sang  but\\r\\nkaren only thought of her red shoes \\r\\n\\r\\nin the afternoon  the old lady heard from everyone that the shoes had\\r\\nbeen red  and she said that it was very wrong of karen  that it was not\\r\\nat all becoming  and that in future karen should only go in black shoes\\r\\nto church  even when she should be older \\r\\n\\r\\nthe next sunday there was the sacrament  and karen looked at the black\\r\\nshoes  looked at the red oneslooked at them again  and put on the red\\r\\nshoes \\r\\n\\r\\nthe sun shone gloriously  karen and the old lady walked along the path\\r\\nthrough the corn  it was rather dusty there \\r\\n\\r\\nat the church door stood an old soldier with a crutch  and with a\\r\\nwonderfully long beard  which was more red than white  and he bowed to\\r\\nthe ground  and asked the old lady whether he might dust her shoes  and\\r\\nkaren stretched out her little foot \\r\\n\\r\\n“see  what beautiful dancing shoes ” said the soldier  “sit firm when\\r\\nyou dance”  and he put his hand out towards the soles \\r\\n\\r\\nand the old lady gave the old soldier alms  and went into the church\\r\\nwith karen \\r\\n\\r\\nand all the people in the church looked at karen's red shoes  and all\\r\\nthe pictures  and as karen knelt before the altar  and raised the cup to\\r\\nher lips  she only thought of the red shoes  and they seemed to swim\\r\\nin it  and she forgot to sing her psalm  and she forgot to pray  “our\\r\\nfather in heaven ”\\r\\n\\r\\nnow all the people went out of church  and the old lady got into her\\r\\ncarriage  karen raised her foot to get in after her  when the old\\r\\nsoldier said \\r\\n\\r\\n“look  what beautiful dancing shoes ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand karen could not help dancing a step or two  and when she began her\\r\\nfeet continued to dance  it was just as though the shoes had power over\\r\\nthem  she danced round the church corner  she could not leave off  the\\r\\ncoachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her  and he lifted\\r\\nher in the carriage  but her feet continued to dance so that she trod on\\r\\nthe old lady dreadfully  at length she took the shoes off  and then her\\r\\nlegs had peace \\r\\n\\r\\nthe shoes were placed in a closet at home  but karen could not avoid\\r\\nlooking at them \\r\\n\\r\\nnow the old lady was sick  and it was said she could not recover  she\\r\\nmust be nursed and waited upon  and there was no one whose duty it was\\r\\nso much as karen's  but there was a great ball in the city  to which\\r\\nkaren was invited  she looked at the old lady  who could not recover \\r\\nshe looked at the red shoes  and she thought there could be no sin in\\r\\nit  she put on the red shoes  she might do that also  she thought  but\\r\\nthen she went to the ball and began to dance \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen she wanted to dance to the right  the shoes would dance to the\\r\\nleft  and when she wanted to dance up the room  the shoes danced back\\r\\nagain  down the steps  into the street  and out of the city gate  she\\r\\ndanced  and was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood \\r\\n\\r\\nthen it was suddenly light up among the trees  and she fancied it must\\r\\nbe the moon  for there was a face  but it was the old soldier with\\r\\nthe red beard  he sat there  nodded his head  and said  “look  what\\r\\nbeautiful dancing shoes ”\\r\\n\\r\\nthen she was terrified  and wanted to fling off the red shoes  but they\\r\\nclung fast  and she pulled down her stockings  but the shoes seemed to\\r\\nhave grown to her feet  and she danced  and must dance  over fields and\\r\\nmeadows  in rain and sunshine  by night and day  but at night it was the\\r\\nmost fearful \\r\\n\\r\\nshe danced over the churchyard  but the dead did not dancethey had\\r\\nsomething better to do than to dance  she wished to seat herself on a\\r\\npoor man's grave  where the bitter tansy grew  but for her there was\\r\\nneither peace nor rest  and when she danced towards the open church\\r\\ndoor  she saw an angel standing there  he wore long  white garments  he\\r\\nhad wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth  his countenance\\r\\nwas severe and grave  and in his hand he held a sword  broad and\\r\\nglittering \\r\\n\\r\\n“dance shalt thou ” said he  “dance in thy red shoes till thou art pale\\r\\nand cold  till thy skin shrivels up and thou art a skeleton  dance shalt\\r\\nthou from door to door  and where proud  vain children dwell  thou shalt\\r\\nknock  that they may hear thee and tremble  dance shalt thou ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“mercy ” cried karen  but she did not hear the angel's reply  for the\\r\\nshoes carried her through the gate into the fields  across roads and\\r\\nbridges  and she must keep ever dancing \\r\\n\\r\\none morning she danced past a door which she well knew  within sounded\\r\\na psalm  a coffin  decked with flowers  was borne forth  then she knew\\r\\nthat the old lady was dead  and felt that she was abandoned by all  and\\r\\ncondemned by the angel of god \\r\\n\\r\\nshe danced  and she was forced to dance through the gloomy night  the\\r\\nshoes carried her over stack and stone  she was torn till she bled  she\\r\\ndanced over the heath till she came to a little house  here  she knew \\r\\ndwelt the executioner  and she tapped with her fingers at the window \\r\\nand said  “come out  come out  i cannot come in  for i am forced to\\r\\ndance ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the executioner said  “thou dost not know who i am  i fancy? i\\r\\nstrike bad people's heads off  and i hear that my axe rings ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“don't strike my head off ” said karen  “then i can't repent of my sins \\r\\nbut strike off my feet in the red shoes ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand then she confessed her entire sin  and the executioner struck off\\r\\nher feet with the red shoes  but the shoes danced away with the little\\r\\nfeet across the field into the deep wood \\r\\n\\r\\nand he carved out little wooden feet for her  and crutches  taught\\r\\nher the psalm criminals always sing  and she kissed the hand which had\\r\\nwielded the axe  and went over the heath \\r\\n\\r\\n“now i have suffered enough for the red shoes ” said she  “now i will\\r\\ngo into the church that people may see me ” and she hastened towards the\\r\\nchurch door: but when she was near it  the red shoes danced before her \\r\\nand she was terrified  and turned round  the whole week she was unhappy \\r\\nand wept many bitter tears  but when sunday returned  she said  “well \\r\\nnow i have suffered and struggled enough  i really believe i am as good\\r\\nas many a one who sits in the church  and holds her head so high ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand away she went boldly  but she had not got farther than the\\r\\nchurchyard gate before she saw the red shoes dancing before her  and she\\r\\nwas frightened  and turned back  and repented of her sin from her heart \\r\\n\\r\\nand she went to the parsonage  and begged that they would take her\\r\\ninto service  she would be very industrious  she said  and would do\\r\\neverything she could  she did not care about the wages  only she wished\\r\\nto have a home  and be with good people  and the clergyman's wife was\\r\\nsorry for her and took her into service  and she was industrious and\\r\\nthoughtful  she sat still and listened when the clergyman read the bible\\r\\nin the evenings  all the children thought a great deal of her  but when\\r\\nthey spoke of dress  and grandeur  and beauty  she shook her head \\r\\n\\r\\nthe following sunday  when the family was going to church  they asked\\r\\nher whether she would not go with them  but she glanced sorrowfully \\r\\nwith tears in her eyes  at her crutches  the family went to hear the\\r\\nword of god  but she went alone into her little chamber  there was only\\r\\nroom for a bed and chair to stand in it  and here she sat down with her\\r\\nprayer-book  and whilst she read with a pious mind  the wind bore\\r\\nthe strains of the organ towards her  and she raised her tearful\\r\\ncountenance  and said  “o god  help me ”\\r\\n\\r\\nand the sun shone so clearly  and straight before her stood the angel\\r\\nof god in white garments  the same she had seen that night at the church\\r\\ndoor  but he no longer carried the sharp sword  but in its stead a\\r\\nsplendid green spray  full of roses  and he touched the ceiling with the\\r\\nspray  and the ceiling rose so high  and where he had touched it there\\r\\ngleamed a golden star  and he touched the walls  and they widened out \\r\\nand she saw the organ which was playing  she saw the old pictures of the\\r\\npreachers and the preachers' wives  the congregation sat in cushioned\\r\\nseats  and sang out of their prayer-books  for the church itself had\\r\\ncome to the poor girl in her narrow chamber  or else she had come into\\r\\nthe church  she sat in the pew with the clergyman's family  and when\\r\\nthey had ended the psalm and looked up  they nodded and said  “it is\\r\\nright that thou art come ”\\r\\n\\r\\n“it was through mercy ” she said \\r\\n\\r\\nand the organ pealed  and the children's voices in the choir sounded so\\r\\nsweet and soft  the clear sunshine streamed so warmly through the window\\r\\ninto the pew where karen sat  her heart was so full of sunshine  peace \\r\\nand joy  that it broke  her soul flew on the sunshine to god  and there\\r\\nno one asked after the red shoes \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nend of project gutenberg's andersen's fairy tales  by hans christian
